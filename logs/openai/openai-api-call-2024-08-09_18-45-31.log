Helpdesk solutions

What is help desk software?
---------------------------

Help desk software typically catches all your incoming communication from customers and transforms it into tickets for easier management. Your customers use all kinds of ways to reach out like email, phone, messengers or live chat, so keeping all communication in one place helps your customer service agents understand the issue better and answer faster.

*   Improve your efficiency with a multi-channel solution
    
*   Manage all of your customer communication from one place

Usability

Who utilizes help desk software?
--------------------------------

Any business that offers [customer support](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/customer-support/ "Learn what customer support is and why it matters. Come and explore best practices and innovative strategies to elevate your support game.") or customer service can utilize [help desk](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/helpdesk/ "What is a help desk? Explore the definition, benefits, differences, and functions for efficient customer support.") software for easy handling of customer inquiries. The responsibility goes to customer support teams, who are the primary users of help desk software. However, help desk systems often come with advanced features to extend their usefulness to other departments.

How does help desk software work?
---------------------------------

If you’ve ever reached out to a company, it’s likely that you have already interacted with help desk software.

But how exactly does it work?

Although the intricate processes that go on behind the scenes may differ for various help desk software providers, their core remains the same.

When a customer contacts a business via email, live chat, [social media](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/social-media-customer-service-best-practices/ "Find out how social media customer service empowers your customers to reach out to your business and take your service to the next level.") message, or other communication channels, a [help desk ticket](https://www.liveagent.com/ticketing-software/ "Explore a selection of ticketing software that are most used on the market. Choose the ideal ticketing tool and raise your customer service to the moon.") is created. The ticket often includes information like the channel the interaction comes from, a message from the customer, SLA, customer information, and others, depending on the [service desk](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/help-desk-vs-service-desk/ "Do you know the difference between the help desk vs service desk? Find out the definition of each and learn why they are not the same.") software you are using and how you configure it.

Once the ticket is created, it is delivered to an inbox. From there, it is assigned to an agent that handles further communication with the customer and tries to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.

In case the first customer service rep can’t solve the problem at hand, the ticket can be escalated to another representative, department, or level that is better equipped to handle more complex issues. This process is referred to as an [escalation path](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/escalation/ "Get to know what escalation is. Understand in-depth explanations from professionals.").

Challenges associated with help desk software
---------------------------------------------

Although help desk management software is an amazing tool that allows you to support many customers all over the world, it also comes with some challenges. Let’s have a look at some of them and discuss possible solutions.

### Low first contact resolution rate

Although it may seem like a simple performance metric, that is not the case. In [contact centers](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/contact-center/ "Discover the ins and outs of a contact center in 2024 - the types, trends, and benefits. Dive deep and explore how it revolutionizes customer service."), [first contact resolution](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/first-contact-resolution/ "Explore the concept of First Contact Resolution (FCR), understand its importance, and uncover the best FCR practices to enhance customer service.") is an important indicator of [customer satisfaction](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/customer-satisfaction/ "Learn the nitty-gritty of customer satisfaction. Why it matters. How to deal with it, and what are some of the best practices.") and whether their expectations are being fulfilled. You may encounter this challenge due to insufficient agent training or an overwhelming number of help desk requests, among other factors.

**Solution**: Prepare your staff for handling even more complex customer issues, analyzing reports and data to determine the best course of action, and developing an efficient escalation procedure.

### Lack of self-service options

Even contact centers with a large number of agents who are properly trained can get overwhelmed by the number of preventable questions they receive.

**Solution:** Develop and then point customers to a reliable and informative self-service portal with a [knowledge base](https://www.liveagent.com/knowledge-base-software/ "Explore a comprehensive guide to the 20 best knowledge base software options, streamlining information management and boosting efficiency"). Be sure that your inbox isn’t flooded with questions that customers can easily answer themselves. SupperOffice research shows that as much as 91% of responders would use a knowledge base if it were available and tailored to their needs.

### Not using the right tools

All businesses are different. Therefore, they need different help desk software solutions encompassing different features.

**Solution:** Thoroughly research the ticketing system software you want to use and make sure that it provides everything your company needs to succeed. Study all the [reports and analytics](https://www.liveagent.com/features/customer-service-reports/ "Start improving your products and services by reviewing customer service reports regularly. Put our reports to the test with our free trial.") you can get your hands on. It is said that knowledge is power, so be sure to understand all the ins and outs of your help desk software’s operations.

### Outdated systems

Did you know that as much as [42%](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/why-to-use-ticketing-system/ "A lot of organizations are still ignoring a ticketing system. This is mainly due to the lack of understanding of the ticketing system benefits.") of agents can’t resolve customer inquiries due to outdated or disconnected systems?

**Solution:** Always stay on top of your game when it comes to patches, updates, and innovations.

### Time-consuming repetitive tasks

Many problems can stem from this challenge alone. If your agents spend hours doing repetitive tasks, they are less engaged and less productive, and there is a higher chance that your [contact center](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/contact-center/ "Discover the ins and outs of a contact center in 2024 - the types, trends, and benefits. Dive deep and explore how it revolutionizes customer service.") will experience a high agent turnover rate.

**Solution:** Use AI and automation features. Having said that, be careful with its implementation. You don’t want to lose that “human touch” that makes customer support a friendly and pleasant experience.

Types of help desk software
---------------------------

[Service desk application](https://www.liveagent.com/help-desk-software/ "Explore a selection of the best help desk software on the market. Choose the ideal help desk software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon.") solutions encompass varying features and functionalities tailored for a wide variety of clients.

The following are the most common types of help desk software solutions.

*   **Internal help desk software** – Allows internal users to quickly and efficiently track and resolve [internal tickets](https://www.liveagent.com/features/internal-tickets/ "Create internal tickets with ease with LiveAgent help desk software. Discover just how easily you can resolve internal issues today.") and issues.
*   **External help desk software** – A paying customer is supported by the vendor’s customer service teams.
*   **Web help desk software** – With cloud-based help desk software, all the information is stored on the host’s servers. It is usually paid via a subscription and the host usually provides tech support.
*   **On-premise help desk software** – All the hardware is located on-premise and the customer is responsible for its smooth operation.
*   **Open-source software** – This is a type of software where anybody can access and alter its code without the need for permission from its producer. Usually, open-source solutions are either free of charge or funded by donations.
*   **Closed-source** – This is the opposite of an open-source model. It is protected by intellectual property and isn’t available to the public.

Features of help desk software
------------------------------

When you’re searching for the best help desk software for your company, you will come across many popular features, options, and integrations various solutions have to offer. However, these are the 10 most important ones that you should first check off of any feature list.

*   **Contact channels** – This is the way your customers contact you. These points of contact may include email support, live chat, call center, social media, [community forums](https://www.liveagent.com/blog/best-forum-software/ "Build an online community with your prospects and customers with the help of comprehensive self-service forum software."), and more.
*   **Ticket management** – It is the core system that organizes customer support interactions and records them as tickets. Not only that but it also allows for further ticket tracking which can help investigate, resolve, and prevent any bottlenecks.
*   **Self-service portal** – Many customers try to resolve their issues independently before contacting customer support teams. Using a self-service portal allows customers to be more independent. Such an approach improves the [customer experience](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/customer-experience/ "All interactions customers have with a company and its services and products are called as customer experience. Learn more about customer experience.") and boosts business efficiency by reducing the workload on customer service agents.
*   **Knowledge base** – No efficient contact center exists without a knowledge base. This feature allows your customers to resolve their problems 24/7 without the need to have an agent present. Furthermore, an [internal knowledge base](https://www.liveagent.com/features/internal-knowledge-base/ "LiveAgent is a help desk solution that also offers a knowledge base. Learn more about the internal knowledge base and get a free trial.") is a crucial part of your agents’ day-to-day activities because it stores all the customer information, ticketing history, and much more.
*   **Intuitive user interface** – Even the most robust and feature-rich customer help desk software will not do you any good if it’s difficult to use. An intuitive user interface is the bread-and-butter of smooth contact center operations.
*   **Reporting and analytics** – Studying reports and analytics provide you with deeper insight into the operation of your contact center, and the business as a whole. Make sure that your help desk tool can provide you with sufficient information.
*   **SLA management** – A smart help desk solution allows you to manage and uphold multiple [service-level agreements](https://www.liveagent.com/features/service-level-agreement-sla/ "Service level agreements (SLAs) can improve the efficiency of your help desk by specifying targets your agents have to meet.") at a time.
*   **Automation** – Automating daily tasks is a must, mostly at large-scale companies with many clients.
*   **Dashboards** – This feature allows agents to get a quick overview of the most important data upon logging in to the system. Contact center managers also use dashboards to monitor key metrics.
*   **Tags** – [Tagging your tickets](https://www.liveagent.com/features/tags/ "Customize and improve your workflow with tags. View each ticket's contents at a glance and categorize them according to topics or segments.") and customer interactions is imperative if you want your contact center to run smoothly and efficiently. Tags not only help to categorize customer support tickets but also allow agents to quickly pull up customer information and better navigate large ticket volumes.

How to choose the best help desk software
-----------------------------------------

First and foremost, we recommend writing a list of all the requirements you have for your new online help desk software.

If you can’t come up with all the needs of your contact center yourself, talk to your staff. They have insights into the daily operations of the contact center, so they’re the best source of information you can get when picking out the software they will ultimately end up working with.

To help you and your staff pick the best business software, below are some strategies to include in the decision-making.

### Support

While nobody likes to think that something might go wrong, it’s important to keep in mind that having support readily available is crucial if you want everything to run smoothly. Nobody likes to wait for hours, or even days, for a reply from customer service teams, so make sure you research the quality of the vendor’s customer support before you make any final decisions.

### Ability to scale up/down

Most business owners have their [company growth](https://www.liveagent.com/blog/8-ways-to-use-customer-insights-to-grow-your-business/ "In this article you can find out 8 tangible ways that customer insights can be used to increase revenues, decrease churn, improve servicing efficiencies.") at the top of their priority lists. Don’t forget, though, that your [contact center](https://www.liveagent.com/contact-center-software/ "Discover leading contact center software to streamline operations and drive profits in 2024. The best fit for your company is just a click away.") must keep up as well. Likewise, the [customer help desk](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/service-desk/ "Service desk is a single point of contact between company and customers, users, business partners. Service desk can be referred as a specific help desk.") software that you use can also be scaled up or down. When picking a help desk software solution you want to purchase, always check how easy it is to scale both ways.

### Software limitations

No matter how amazing the software you use is, there are always some hiccups and limitations along the way. Take your time to study the capabilities of the software you’re considering getting and decide which features you can and can’t live without.

### Collaboration options

In a contact center environment, teamwork is the name of the game. Handling multiple issues at once, providing [chat support](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/live-chat-support/ "Live chat is one of the tools of a help desk software that enables customers to contact you through your website.") while being on a call, and getting a social media mention is not a job for a lone wolf. Choose help desk software that allows your team to [collaborate seamlessly](https://www.liveagent.com/features/collaboration-tools/ "Collaboration tools allow team members to communicate, solve problems, share and work together with more ease and efficiency."). It will make their jobs easier as well as improve the overall business productivity.

### Integrations

Ensure that your help desk software can connect with different sites and applications. It not only makes your products and services more accessible but also provides an excellent unified customer experience across the board.

What is the best help desk software?
------------------------------------

We can agree that there are many options to choose from, but don’t worry, we’ve picked out the top 5 for you to compare.

*   **LiveAgent** – With a [Capterra rating of 4.7](https://www.capterra.com/p/102188/LiveAgent/reviews/ "P - 102188 - LiveAgent - Reviews"), this is the best option for all those who seek a help desk solution that is affordable and has a [wide repertoire of features](https://www.liveagent.com/features/ "Are you looking for a feature-rich help desk solution? LiveAgent is a help desk software with more than 180 features available."). Another reason why LiveAgent is the top help desk software for your business is that it helps increase conversions, drive sales, and create the best [holistic customer experience](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-experience-software/ "Customer experience software plays a key role in collecting, organizing, and tracking customer feedback in a modern-day business.") no matter the industry you are in.
*   **TeamSupport** – If you try to provide complex and customer-focused services, TeamSupport might be just the solution for you. With a Capterra rating of 4.5, you can rest assured that this help desk software option will not disappoint.
*   **Salesforce Service Cloud** – Bringing AI and automation to your customer service operations has never been easier. Salesforce Service Cloud boasts a 4.5 rating on Capterra, so you know you’ll be investing in software of the best quality.
*   **Zendesk** – Having a client base of more than 160 000 businesses and a 4.4 Capterra rating, Zendesk is an amazing opportunity for every company that is trying to build relationships with their customers through engagement and great customer support.
*   **Jira Service Management** – Boasting a 4.4 rating on Capterra, Jira Service Management will make implementing the agile methodology in your company a piece of cake.

Mistakes to avoid when buying a help desk software
--------------------------------------------------

*   **Insufficient staff training** – You can invest in the best and most reliable feature-rich help desk software, but if your team isn’t able to harness its full potential, it will not do you any good. Make sure that the customer service agents and other employees are properly trained and can interact with the software. You can do this by hiring a licensed coach, holding seminars, or even by studying and discussing available documentation.
*   **No needed features** – Don’t hurry while picking out the software you want to purchase. Study the features it offers. Does it provide everything you need? Are there any limitations that are a deal-breaker for you? Ask questions and be critical before you buy. You don’t want to end up realizing down the line that your help desk software solution doesn’t have enough features for you to be successful.
*   **Not taking full advantage of the trial period** – If the provider you decide to go with offers a [trial period](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/free-trial/ "Get to know more about the free trial Understand in depth with explanations from professionals."), use it to the max. Try everything you can, study the software, make mistakes and learn from them. That’s what the free trial period is about. Make sure you take note of all the functionalities and powerful features, as well as the quirks that software inevitably comes with. Don’t overlook help desk freeware, it might be just enough to meet your needs.
*   **Discount dealing** – Let’s be honest, we all like it when we can bargain a good price. However, in a product so deeply ingrained in your day-to-day contact center activities, you need to be careful and pay attention to what is worth paying a higher price for.
*   **Not looking into the future** – Operating a successful contact center is a marathon, not a sprint. Look into the future. Decide on the online help desk software that will not only serve you now, but become a valuable part of your business in the future based on your plans for later expansion.

What to ask on a demo call about help desk software and the company

Some of the most common questions asked on demo calls in regards to help desk software are:

*   What is the difference between you and others?

*   Can I merge a ticket?
