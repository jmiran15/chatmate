Looking for the best LiveAgent alternatives?

LiveAgent is a well-known help desk software solution that boasts over 180 features and more than 150 integrations. It‚Äôs designed to streamline customer support and enhance communication across various channels. With its live chat, ticketing system, and AI-powered assistance, LiveAgent aims to provide a comprehensive support experience.

However, while LiveAgent offers a robust set of tools, it may not be the perfect fit for every business.

**Pricing of LiveAgent:**

- **Free Plan:** 7 days ticket history, 1 email address, 1 chat button, 1 contact form.
- **Paid Plans:** Start at $9/agent/month (billed annually) or $15 monthly.

Doesn‚Äôt sound too bad, right? But as your business grows, you might find that LiveAgent lacks certain features or flexibility that other platforms offer.

- Limited customization options for advanced workflows.
- The user interface may feel outdated compared to newer solutions.
- Some users report challenges with customer support response times.
- Pricing can escalate quickly as you add more agents.
