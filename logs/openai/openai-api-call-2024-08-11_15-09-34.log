  2. Extract relevant information for the following categories:
     - Product name (be as specific as possible, including any version numbers if applicable)
     - Tagline (the main slogan or catchphrase used to describe the product)
     - Short description (a concise overview of what the product does)
     - Unique selling proposition (what sets this product apart from competitors)
     - Primary use case (the main problem this product solves or its primary function)
     - Key features (important capabilities or aspects of the product)
     - Pros (advantages or benefits of using the product)
     - Cons (limitations, drawbacks, or potential issues with the product)
     - Pricing plans (all available pricing tiers and what they include)
     - Integrations (other tools or services this product can work with)
     - Support options (ways users can get help or assistance)
  
  3. Use verbatim quotes from the provided content. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or infer information not explicitly stated.
  
  4. Include the exact source URL for each piece of extracted information. If a piece of information appears on multiple pages, include all relevant URLs.
  
  5. Be thorough: look for information in all parts of the website content, including navigation menus, footers, and any linked pages provided.
  
  6. If you cannot find information for a category, explicitly state "No information found" for that category.

Security and enterprise controls
--------------------------------

Streamlined management of user access, security settings, and billing details for efficient collaboration and project control.

### Security

Automate administrative tasks, apply security controls, and ensure company data is protected.

[Visit our Trust Center](https://www.smartsheet.com/trust/security)

#### 

Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)

**Ensure administrators have the necessary tools to protect sensitive information.**

Gain full control of access to your data with customer-managed encryption keys, stored and handled through Amazon Web Services Key Management System (AWS KMS). As a customer, you own and govern your encryption keys, giving you the power to configure, rotate, and completely revoke access to your company's data.

#### 

E-signatures

**Enhance document security and streamline the approval process.**

Allow users to request and receive legally-binding signatures directly within their workflows. This secure method ensures authenticity and consent on documents, all while maintaining compliance and audit trails within the Smartsheet platform.

[Learn more](https://help.smartsheet.com/learning-track/best-practice-webinars/document-builder)

#### 

Data retention controls

**Ensure only current, relevant data is stored in your Smartsheet account.**

Provide robust security options, enabling organizations to manage the lifecycle of their content with precision. These controls allow administrators to set policies for retaining, archiving, and deleting data according to company security guidelines and regulatory requirements, ensuring sensitive information is protected and disposed of responsibly.

[Learn more](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2482311-customer-managed-encryption-keys)

#### 

Data egress

**Prevent confidential data from leaving your Smartsheet account.**

System administrators can enforce company egress policies to regulate how external collaborators handle data, with the ability to restrict actions such as saving new copies, saving as templates, sending attachments, publishing, printing, and exporting. Should an external collaborator try to perform any of these restricted actions, they will be notified that the action is blocked in adherence to the company’s egress policies.

#### 

Smartsheet Regions

**Choose specific geographic locations where your data is stored and managed.**

By selecting a data region, customers can ensure information resides in their preferred location, enhancing control over data sovereignty, and meeting regional compliance and policy requirements. This feature is particularly important for organizations with compliance requirements to keep data within certain national boundaries due to privacy laws and regulations.

#### 

Activity log

**See who made which changes and when, on sheets, reports, and dashboards.**

Activity Log provides a detailed audit trail, capturing changes, access, and sharing activities related to sheets, reports, or dashboards, ensuring transparency and aiding in compliance and monitoring efforts.

### Administration

Enable centralized control over users, access privileges, and settings, simplifying the management of your organization's account.

#### 

Admin tools

**Manage and audit user access, ownership, and activity.**

Configure global security settings, such as account discovery, resource management, and personalized welcome screens. Define user roles, detailing specific permissions within the Smartsheet account, utilize automated user provisioning for seamless enterprise account integration, and customize account settings to tailor features and set working days according to organizational needs.

Enterprise plan manager

**Manage and govern multiple plans while maintaining individual teams’ granular control over their plan and billing.**

Optimize your organization's billing structures for flexibility and allow teams to integrate essential premium applications for their tasks. System Admins can authenticate all company domains, consolidate visibility of all existing plans under IT control, and establish a uniform SAML SSO login for all plans, ensuring that access can be globally revoked when an employee departs, streamlining administrative functions and enhancing security.

#### 

Do you have special discounts if we're a non-profit?

Smartsheet supports eligible nonprofit organizations with discounts on annual plans.

Eligible organizations have current, valid 501c(3) status in the United States or equivalent status in other countries.

An organization will _**NOT**_ be eligible if any of the following conditions apply: 1) it is an educational institution; 2) it is a governmental office or department; 3) it is a hospital or other healthcare provider or an organization involved with health insurance; 4) it engages in political or legislative activity; 5) it is a private grant-making, independent, or operating foundation with an endowment greater than $10M; 6) it is a financial institution;  7) it is an advocacy group or a group that otherwise attempts to influence public opinion; or 8) it discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political affiliation or beliefs, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Smartsheet reserves the right to decide who is eligible for this discount program.

During your purchase process, indicate that you are a nonprofit and tell us a little about your organization. Smartsheet reserves the right to reset pricing for customers who mistakenly receive nonprofit pricing to standard commercial price points.
