Cost of ticketing software
--------------------------

The pricing for ticketing [help desk software](https://www.liveagent.com/help-desk-software/ "Explore a selection of the best help desk software on the market. Choose the ideal help desk software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon.") can range from free to very expensive. This depends on many factors. You always need to consider a few things before you decide to pick a system. The costs can vary because of features and their quality, the number of custom integrations, the popularity of the selected brand, [usability in various scenarios](https://www.liveagent.com/use-case-scenarios/ "L&L Europe, Huawei, Hostinger, and other companies offer various online services, from gaming to web hosting and ecommerce solutions. LiveAgent provides support for customer satisfaction and business growth."), scalability, and many other factors. There are a few pricing models that need to be considered to make sure a help desk system is worth it and suits your business model.

### Pricing models of ticketing software

#### Per ticket

Per ticket pricing models let you pay for what you need. This pricing model is ideal for help desks with low numbers of customer tickets. The biggest downside might be a lack of motivation for agents to handle support, as every handled ticket equals a larger sum paid to the service provider.

#### Per license

License pricing models can include licenses for one or more users. Everyone who has it can use the software indefinitely as long as the price has been paid. The price for a license can be a lump sum or on a subscription basis.

#### Per device

Similar to the license pricing model, you can pay a lump sum or a subscription fee that lets you use ticketing software on multiple devices. The final sum stacks for each device used in a help desk.

#### Per agent

The [agent](https://www.liveagent.com/features/agents/ "In LiveAgent agents and customer representatives with the admin role can also supervise and configure the system. Read about user types and more.")\-based model is the most common and the most preferred as it gives you fair conditions. Your price depends on the number of software users. They can use the software with every paid feature with no limits set by ticketing or runtime.

How to choose the best ticketing software
-----------------------------------------

### Commitments

Become familiar with ticketing solutions and learn about the software commitments. These include base pricing, software or hardware requirements, built-in features, integrations, supported [customer communication channels](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-communications-management-software/ "LiveAgent customer communication management software will provide personalized, quick, and knowledgeable service to your customers. Try it for free."), and even customer support for help desk users. Once you get all the vital information, you can make an informed decision about what software is best for your situation.

### Pricing

The most common issues regarding choosing the best ticketing software for your business include pricing options. Ticketing software prices depend on a few factors, such as basic [features](https://www.liveagent.com/features/ "Are you looking for a feature-rich help desk solution? LiveAgent is a help desk software with more than 180 features available."), [integrations](https://www.liveagent.com/integrations/ "LiveAgent provides a large number of integrations in the form of plugins. Check out all the available integration solutions right now."), reliability, and more. Make sure to consider all of these options and compare pricing tiers to ensure you will get the software you need without overpaying.

### Support

Any help desk software should provide stellar support for its users. Therefore, user-friendly [self-service options](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-portal-software/ "Customer portal software will increase customer loayalty and sales. Try LiveAgent's 30-day free trial and make your customer service great.") and direct contact options are a necessity. LiveAgent customers can contact our 24/7 support line via email, live chat, or phone at any time. You can also browse through our external knowledge customer base for self-service options.

### Provided contact options

Provide stellar customer service with a selection of tools that help you reach every important customer channel. For example, give your customers the options to contact you via email, [live chat](https://www.liveagent.com/live-chat-software/ "Explore a selection of the best live chat software on the market. Choose the ideal live chat software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon."), [calls](https://www.liveagent.com/call-center-software/ "Explore a selection of the best call center software on the market. Choose the ideal call center software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon."), or even [social media](https://www.liveagent.com/social-media-customer-service/ "LiveAgent is a help desk solution that connects multiple channels in one interface. Find out more about LiveAgent and its business/industry benefits."). With the addition of a customer portal and external [knowledge base](https://www.liveagent.com/knowledge-base-software/ "Explore a comprehensive guide to the 20 best knowledge base software options, streamlining information management and boosting efficiency"), you can ensure your customers will find their preferred option.

### Ability to scale up/down

Are you feeling overwhelmed with incoming requests? Every good ticketing software can help you scale up whenever necessary and help you create room for more [customer support agents](https://www.liveagent.com/features/agents/ "In LiveAgent agents and customer representatives with the admin role can also supervise and configure the system. Read about user types and more."). It works the other way around too. Feel free to downgrade whenever you feel like you’re overpaying for features you don’t use.

### Software limitations

Your customer support team should have everything necessary to provide support. Software limitations don’t have to be a necessarily bad thing, especially for [help desks](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/help-desk-vs-service-desk/ "Do you know the difference between the help desk vs service desk? Find out the definition of each and learn why they are not the same.") that don’t require every tool and feature software can offer. Consider everything you need and [pick the best options for a fair price](https://www.liveagent.com/costs-calculator/ "LiveAgent is a help desk solution that connects multiple channels in one interface. Find out more about LiveAgent and its business/industry benefits.")

### Collaboration options

Customer service reps should work as a unit. Take advantage of help desk [collaboration tools](https://www.liveagent.com/features/collaboration-tools/ "Collaboration tools allow team members to communicate, solve problems, share and work together with more ease and efficiency."), share customer profiles, and easily cooperate on customer issues. Anyone can pitch in. LiveAgent can help you with [notes](https://www.liveagent.com/features/notes/ "Discover LiveAgent's help desk notes. Share progress and updates with colleagues privately, and collect more information about your contacts."), [tags](https://www.liveagent.com/features/tags/ "Customize and improve your workflow with tags. View each ticket's contents at a glance and categorize them according to topics or segments."), [contact information](https://www.liveagent.com/features/contacts/ "Manage and view information about your customers, e.g., language preferences or any customer data captured in LiveAgent's custom Contact fields."), and [splitting customer tickets](https://www.liveagent.com/features/split-tickets/ "Do you have a ticket regarding multiple issues? Split a ticket into two or more and let different agents handle separate customer issues.") when necessary.

In 2006, [LiveAgent](https://www.liveagent.com/tour/ "Take a tour of LiveAgent and discover all amazing tools and features in our multi-channel help desk app. Try it out today and improve your customer service.") started because the founders could not find a great [customer support tool](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-service-software/ "Acquiring customer service software is a significant investment, so we’ve created a list of the top 10 solutions you should consider.") that allowed [live chat](https://www.liveagent.com/live-chat-software/ "Explore a selection of the best live chat software on the market. Choose the ideal live chat software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon."), so they made one themselves. In 2011, they expanded the software’s features to include a help desk ticketing system. Now, LiveAgent has more than 45 ticketing features and over 200 integrations as well as the support of third-party integrations and is easy to use and set up.

#### Key features

*   Canned Messages
*   Shared Inbox
*   Automated ticket distribution
*   Hundreds of native integrations
*   Self-service knowledge base
*   Self-service portal and forum

#### Pros and cons

LiveAgent is a strong choice for those on a budget, as it is reasonably priced, even at its highest tier. However, it does not support SAML single sign-on for [enterprises](https://www.liveagent.com/business/enterprise/ "Liveagent is the most reviewed and #1 rated help desk software for smb in 2019. Large businesses often get their roi from liveagent quickly with real-time typing view feature.") with hundreds of employees.

#### Price

*   **Free**
*   **Small** – $9/agent/month
*   **Medium** – $29/agent/month
*   **Large** – $49/agent/month

### 2\. Zoho Desk

![Image 121: Zoho desk ticketing system homepage](https://www.liveagent.com/wp/urlslab-download/b2b2f995dda93c26b3a413ddb13ccdea/zoho-desk-homepage-1024x557.png)

They launched a help desk ticketing system in 2016 that integrates with many apps developed by Zoho. In total, between its multitude of apps for every level of business, which still drops every few months, they have reached over 60 million users. Moreover, they have comprehensive and reasonably priced cloud-based software.

#### Recommended for all-size businesses

Zoho Desk is a scalable system from one employee to hundreds. Users of Zoho also have the added library of Zoho products that integrate with the Zoho Desk.

#### Key features

*   Omnichannel
*   Workflow Automation
*   Platform integration
*   Self-service knowledge base
*   Artificial intelligence

#### Pros and cons

While reasonably priced, the ability to add a light agent is an additional $6 per month (and 50 free light agents at the highest tier). Light agents have restricted help desk privileges as they are not part of the customer support team but can support [customer service interactions](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/customer-interaction/ "Developing good relations with your customers through customer interactions can play a pivotal role in determining the position of your brand in the market."). It also lacks a SAML single sign-on, and its [customer relationship](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/customer-relationship/ "Customer relationship begins when a customer starts dealing with your company. Build an effective CR with LiveAgent.") management (CRM) integration is with a different product from Zoho. One of the main features that sets it apart is its AI Zia, which is a powerful addition to the support staff but is only available for the highest tier. Moreover, they do have the added benefit of a reduced price if billed annually

#### Price

*   **Free**
*   **Standard** – $20/agent/month ($14/agent/annually)
*   **Professional** – $35/agent/month ($23/agent/annually)
*   **Enterprise** – $50/agent/month ($40/agent/annually)

### 3\. HappyFox

![Image 122: Happyfox helpdesk ticketing system homepage](https://www.liveagent.com/wp/urlslab-download/5046db5e7348ef1f9d4b300656d23745/happyfow-homepage-1024x612.png)

A quick-to-set-up, web-based help desk, HappyFox offers immense customization options, administration governance, and security features that will benefit a large business. In addition, it is easy to use and offers many features that allow [customer self-service](https://www.liveagent.com/self-service-software/ "Customer self-service software by LiveAgent will extend your support capabilities. Enable your customers to resolve issues on their own 24/7.") to lighten the workload of your agents.

#### Recommended for medium to large size businesses

Because there is no free option and their pricing options start at $29 per agent per month, it is not an easy sell for those on a budget. The upside is that they offer unlimited agent service but limit tickets per year for more extensive operations. The company provides single sign-on and tools to maintain governance and security for [large businesses](https://www.liveagent.com/business/enterprise/ "Liveagent is the most reviewed and #1 rated help desk software for smb in 2019. Large businesses often get their roi from liveagent quickly with real-time typing view feature.").

#### Key features

*   Omnichannel
*   Internal and external knowledge base
*   Customization
*   Administration and security functions

#### Pros and cons

There is a requirement of 5 agents for all plans, but it is difficult to gauge whether this is a good or bad thing without knowing the pricing structure.

#### Price

Prices are not readily available, but they offer four tiers of agent-based pricing starting at $29/agent/month. There are also four tiers of unlimited agents with ticket and custom [field](https://www.liveagent.com/features/ticket-fields/ "Gather more information about your customers' tickets with LiveAgent's ticket fields feature. Create unlimited custom fields today.") limits. Limits begin at 10,000 tickets per year and ten custom [fields](https://www.liveagent.com/features/ticket-fields/ "Gather more information about your customers' tickets with LiveAgent's ticket fields feature. Create unlimited custom fields today."), and the highest tier has 250,000 tickets per year and 200 custom fields.

#### Recommended for all-size businesses

Help Scout is designed to grow with your business and supports all sizes of businesses. The lowest tiers start with a broad range of features. The service includes more advanced security like HIPAA-compliant features and single sign-on capabilities with the middle and highest plans.

#### Key features

*   Shared inbox
*   Knowledge base
*   Customer management
*   HIPAA Compliance
*   SSO/SAML
*   Security

#### Pros and cons

They offer a 15-day trial of their two lower tiers, but the highest tier, while it shows robust features that any enterprise would be looking for, does not have a price listed. Help Scout is an option that allows companies to upgrade their plan as their company scales. It does not offer a free version.

#### Price

*   **Standard** – $25/agent/month ($20/agent/annually)
*   **Plus** – $50/agent/month ($40/agent/annually)
*   **Enterprise** – Upon request (Annual only)

While not as common as other help desk ticketing systems on this list, KB Support focuses on being the best support tool plugin for WordPress and eCommerce websites.

#### Recommended for small to medium businesses

This product is geared for starting businesses on the web, with plugins specifically for WordPress and eCommerce integration.

#### Key features

*   Submission forms
*   Guest tickets
*   Knowledge base with the ability to restrict articles
*   Agent permissions
*   Auto-assign
*   SLA tracker

#### Pros and cons

While KB support has a low yearly billing cost, it does require a year’s commitment after paying for it. They have the option to purchase specific plugins included with each tier of the plan, so you can decide what you do and do not need, though the bundles do come at a significant discount. Outside of the cost, the con is that there is no smart assigning technology at work; it just assigns randomly or based on active tickets per user.

#### Price

For a single site, billed annually (price increases per site to an unlimited plan):

*   **Starter** – $74
*   **Professional** – $102
*   **Enterprise** – $150

### 6\. Zendesk

![Image 125: Zendesk ticketing software homepage](https://www.liveagent.com/wp/urlslab-download/3ece8c36f946be05c82163df485d51f0/zendesk-homepage-1024x647.png)

One of the most well-known help desk ticketing systems, Zendesk has many options starting at €19 per agent per month with the basic features, and their enterprise-ready plan starts at €99 per agent per month.

#### Key features

*   Live chat

*   Answer bot
*   Knowledge base
*   Social media integration
*   Sandbox test
*   Light access licenses

The features of Zendesk are extensive, with plans that range from small businesses to corporation levels. Billed annually or month to month, there is no commitment to Zendesk outside of those terms (there is no refund for cancellation or downgrading).

#### Price

*   **Support Team** – $19 per agent/month billed annually
*   **Support Professional** – $49 per agent/month billed annually

While offering many help desk options, from customer service to IT support, Vision [Helpdesk](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/helpdesk/ "What is a help desk? Explore the definition, benefits, differences, and functions for efficient customer support.") is a help desk ticketing system that focuses on your employees with collaboration and gamification features that encourage a positive work environment. However, that does not mean they lose sight of the customer, which offers a multi-channel approach for customers to interact with support.

#### Recommended for small businesses

This system will create a centralized help desk for your business with customizable workflows. Although it is reasonably priced, it does not have the broad range of features some larger enterprises need.

#### Key features

*   Automation
*   Gamification
*   Billing
*   Multi-channel

#### Pros and cons

While Vision Helpdesk is available in both SaaS cloud and downloadable licenses, the SaaS cloud license is only available in the US, UK, EU, and India. However, they do have a 30-day, no-obligation software free trial.

This system is geared more towards billable customer service hours than general customer service, and the live chat function is a separate purchase.

#### Price

*   **Starter** – $12 per agent per month, billed annually / $15 per agent billed month-to-month
*   **Pro** – $20 per agent per month billed annually / $25 per agent billed month-to-month
*   **Satellite Help Desk** – $24 per agent per month billed annually / $30 per agent billed month-to-month

Like others on this list, HubSpot Service Hub is set up to grow with you and is a recognizable name, as they offer many other products.

#### Recommended for all-size businesses

The HubSpot Service Hub system is an option that will scale with your business with both free and paid versions depending on your company’s needs. The higher tiers offer essential features for a large business as it grows.

#### Key features

*   Ticket routing
*   NPS surveys
*   Single sign-on
*   Slack integration
*   Field-level permissions

#### Pros and cons

They offer a free version with many of the essential features you need to get started. Still, [ticket automation](https://www.liveagent.com/features/automated-ticket-distribution/ "Automatically rotate phone duty, and set pause times for your agents if needed. Learn more about LiveAgent's automated ticket distribution.") does not begin until the $50 per month plan, which includes two agents and the ability to add additional users for $25 each at the starting level. At the highest level, it is an annual commitment.

#### Price

*   **Free tools**
*   **Starter** – Starts at $50/mo billed monthly (Starts at two paid users)
*   **Professional** – Starts at $450/mo billed monthly (Starts at five paid users)

Marketed as a [help desk solution](https://www.liveagent.com/help-desk-software/ "Explore a selection of the best help desk software on the market. Choose the ideal help desk software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon.") that creates a more personalized experience for customers, Front removes ticket numbers to give the customer a personal response. It is easy and intuitive, and automation keeps track of assigning inquiries to the right support team member.

#### Recommended for all-size businesses

#### Key features

*   Team inboxes
*   Analytics
*   Message templates
*   Rules
*   Assignments

#### Pros and cons

There is no ticketing system, but it works by organizing support through shared inboxes and assigning them through automatic load balancing. While the ticketing system does not automate the assignments, you can build rules which will do that (custom rules are only available at the $49 level tier).

There is also a year-long commitment.

#### Price

*   **Starter** – $19 per person, per month, billed annually
*   **Growth** – $49 per person, per month, billed annually
*   **Scale** – $99 per person, per month, billed annually

This system is an affordable option for small and medium businesses, which seek to simplify the experience of using a help desk system. It offers customization options and third-party app integration.

#### Recommended for small to medium businesses

While the amount of value for the cost is high with Azure desk, the fact that they only have one plan which lacks enterprise-level features limits its usability to small and medium businesses

#### Key features

*   Ticket management
*   Unlimited mailbox
*   App integrations
*   Reporting
*   Collaboration
*   Knowledge base

#### Pros and cons

A 14-day free trial is available; however, only one plan option is available. The plan has many features, but the scope of scalability is limited. There are no advanced features for enterprises, such as security or governance.

#### Price

*   **One plan** – $33 per user per month billed annually ($50 per user per month billed monthly).

### 11\. SupportBee

[Zoom in![Image 130: Supportbee IT ticketing system homepage](https://www.liveagent.com/wp/urlslab-download/5151fe8a0eeaf300cf60ea9ddf5d1897/supportbee-homepage.png)](https://www.liveagent.com/app/uploads/2022/01/supportbee-homepage.png "App - Uploads - 2022 - 01 - Supportbee Homepage.png")

#### Key features

*   Shared inbox
*   Knowledge Base
*   Customer portal
*   App integration

#### Pros and cons

While very affordable, the features and functionality of SupportBee are not as extensive or comprehensive as those offered by other companies at the same price point. Also, the customer [portal software](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-portal-software/ "Customer portal software will increase customer loayalty and sales. Try LiveAgent's 30-day free trial and make your customer service great.") is only available at the higher tier. But, overall, it is a simplified ticketing system that will work well for smaller companies.

#### Price

*   **Startup** – $15 /user/month or $13 /user/month billed annually
*   **Enterprise** – $20 /user/month or $17 /user/month billed annually

#### Price

*   **Free**
*   **Growth –** €15 /agent/month, billed annually – €18/agent/month, billed monthly
*   **Pro –** €49/agent/month, billed annually – €59/agent/month, billed monthly

Explore the definition, benefits, differences, and functions for efficient customer support.") plugin for WordPress, with over 10,000 active installs.

#### Recommended for all-size businesses

While there are large WordPress-based sites, like Microsoft news and BBC America, this is best for a smaller company as it needs to include more security and management features to be more useful higher up. However, even if these are unnecessary for a larger company, unlimited agents are a huge selling point.

#### Key features

*   No per agent fees
*   Customizable
*   Ticket history
*   Time tracking
*   Automatic ticket assignments

#### Pros and cons

Although they offer unlimited agents and unlimited tickets, you will have to commit to using the product for a year. The upside is that each tier is very affordable for any business level, but they do not have the options a large business would need.

#### Price

*   **Standard** – $149 per year
*   **Pro** – $229 per year
*   **Enterprise** – $289 per year
*   **Agency** – $409 per year

### 14\. TeamSupport

It has omnichannel support that facilitates collaboration and streamlines customer support tickets by integrating with software already in your tool kit.

#### Recommended for large businesses

The support service of this system has a lot to offer, but the starting cost per agent per month is high, which means that it may be out of reach for some smaller companies.

#### Key features

*   Purpose-Built for B2B
*   Ticket Management
*   Customer Management
*   Integrations
*   Customer Self Service Portal

#### Pros and cons

Many features focus on B2B customer service and IT support. The downside is that the lowest tier costs $49 per agent per month, relatively costly compared to some other help desk ticketing systems with similar features and a lower price point.

#### Price

*   **Essential Support** – $49 per agent per month
*   **Enterprise Support** – $69 per agent per month
*   **Complete Customer Support Suite** – $119 per agent per month

Plus has a broad range of features, without knowing the cost details, it is difficult to recommend it to specific size businesses. Pricing plans seem to scale well with each level of business.

#### Key features

*   Best practice ITSM workflows
*   Smart automation
*   Integration
*   Codeless customization

#### Price

Is a trial version of the help desk ticketing system useful?
------------------------------------------------------------

A trial version is always helpful when deciding between help desk ticketing systems. Before you commit to a service, you should experience what it will be like to use it every day. The service could have all of the features you are looking for and still not be suitable for you. Sometimes the feel of a system is not right, and you need to try it to see. It is just like a pair of jeans, it can look good on the mannequin but not be the right fit for you.

The same is true for any of your customers. They chose your brand because it works for them. Therefore, you should try it before you buy it.

Right now, LiveAgent is available for a [14-day trial](https://www.liveagent.com/trial/ "Considering LiveAgent help desk software? Fill in your details and you can start your Free Trial, no strings attached, no credit card info needed.") of their all-inclusive plan with no credit card required. It will take less than a minute to sign up and start your test drive.

Mistakes to avoid when buying ticketing software
------------------------------------------------

### No trained staff

Unless you want to focus only on [canned messages](https://www.liveagent.com/features/canned-messages-macros/ "Discover how canned messages can improve your productivity and workflow. Create an unlimited number of canned messages today!"), your staff should be trained in both basics and advanced sides of ticketing and customer support. That’s why ticketing software should be easy for everyone to learn, even in complex event scenarios, and help your agents learn how to use fully-featured [helpdesk software](https://www.liveagent.com/help-desk-software/ "Explore a selection of the best help desk software on the market. Choose the ideal help desk software for your website and raise your customer service to the moon."). LiveAgent system offers a handy start-up guide that will teach anybody how to set up everything and get started. The [Academy](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/ "Would you like to improve your knowledge about customer service? Check out our extensive guides, tips & tricks inside LiveAgent academy.") is full of articles that cover the entire spectrum of help desk systems such as ticketing, live chat, call center, and more. Furthermore, it can help your agents learn how to become full-fledged help desk experts and reliable customer service agents.

### More features don’t equal a better product

[Customer interaction](https://www.liveagent.com/academy/customer-interaction/ "Developing good relations with your customers through customer interactions can play a pivotal role in determining the position of your brand in the market.") doesn’t always require every tool, service channel, or advanced feature at your disposal. Different businesses require different solutions with regard to ticketing challenges. Overpaying for features you won’t ever use can impair agent performance and lead to complications with your customer service platform. Make sure to take full advantage of free trials to find out what works for you and what doesn’t.

### Not taking full advantage of a trial

Trials are important because they allow us to try out the system and its interface with features. Don’t skip a free trial because of the fancy talk you read on a website. Free trials let you try out basic features and show you how to handle complex events and situations in everyday customer support.

### Not thinking ahead of expansion

[The help desk](https://www.liveagent.com/customer-support-glossary/helpdesk/ "What is a help desk? Explore the definition, benefits, differences, and functions for efficient customer support.") interface with features you currently pay for may be enough, but have you considered what will happen when you upgrade? Most robust ticketing systems offer various paid plans that come with or without some features. Make sure to pick a solution that will allow you to upgrade and cater to your needs when necessary.

What to ask on a demo call about IT ticketing systems
-----------------------------------------------------

### Customer queries

There are a few key things hundreds of organizations ask on [demo calls](https://www.liveagent.com/demo/ "Would you like to learn more about LiveAgent? Request a free demo to learn more about LiveAgent and how it can help you succeed."). First of all, you need to find out what you’re going to pay for. Ask about supported customer communication hub or channel options, features included in plans, and supported third-party integrations with other software. Then, come the pricing options. The total cost of ownership is one of the key priorities.

### Implementation of help desk ticketing system

The implementation of ticketing software is generally an easy process that can differ in a few regards. The main difference is between web-based and application-based software. In general, you skip the installation process with web-based solutions and start using them right away. All you need is to provide your email address and register for a free trial. Once you confirm your email, you can log in and get familiar with the help desk platform. As an example, LiveAgent offers a handy getting started guide right from the start. It leads every new user through a few simple steps that help them set up their new solution.

### What is the top ticketing tool?

The best help desk ticketing system is one that makes your operation more efficient and empowers self-serve options for customers to reduce your employee’s workload. Solutions like LiveAgent have robust customization options to create workflows that are specific to your business. The best system is the one most suitable for your unique requirements.

### The best help desk ticketing system for small businesses

When you are a small business, the aim of your choice should be ROI, value, and scalability. Therefore, finding a system that meets your needs at an affordable price is the ideal scenario.

Simple ticketing system providers offer a free version of their software with limited capabilities. LiveAgent offers a free plan which gives you the basics of everything you will need to get started, like a chat button, basic reporting, and the customer portal. Another reasonably priced option is Zoho Desk, which also offers a free version. From there, you can choose to upgrade to a paid plan.

### The best help desk ticketing system for medium businesses

As your business continues to grow, there are more options in the mid-level market of help desk ticketing systems, as more money means more features. At this point, you probably have a growing team of helpdesk agents. You should be focusing on pulling them together with systems that foster collaboration and can integrate with the various applications you already have and those that you plan to grow. However, there should still be a focus on value, as you probably do not want to break the budget for too many features.

LiveAgent can [integrate over 190 programs](https://www.liveagent.com/integrations/ "LiveAgent provides a large number of integrations in the form of plugins. Check out all the available integration solutions right now.") at this level, including social media. Social media is precious for your marketing campaigns, especially if you’re an up-and-coming brand. Answering questions and concerns on social media will help to expand your brand and create memorable customer interactions. Like other help desk ticketing systems, it also integrates with Slack to help maintain seamless communication between team members. Another great option is Jira Service Desk because it boasts a massive assortment of integrating options as well.

### The best help desk ticketing system for large businesses

[Large businesses](https://www.liveagent.com/business/enterprise/ "Liveagent is the most reviewed and #1 rated help desk software for smb in 2019. Large businesses often get their roi from liveagent quickly with real-time typing view feature.") can go all out. Now that you can afford all the bells and whistles, it is time to look at all the features you want and need. But, looking for value is still always the best course of action, no matter how much money you have to work with.

The heavy hitters of the space, LiveAgent, Zendesk, and Jira Service Desk, offer some qualities others do not have, like collaborative features, automations, and single sign-on. Single sign-on allows users to access the software using existing credentials, like signing in with a Google account.

This does not mean they are the only options. Depending on what you need as a large business in the form of customer support, you may be better off going with a more cost-effective option that has what you need. For example, LiveAgent has a plethora of features, while its highest tier of service is reasonably priced, offering a similar value to some help desk systems that cost much more.

Conclusion
----------
