We use the portal feature to support a big pilar of our business. With portals and forms, **we can capture information without errors, and the database helps us organize and centralize information.**

Rubens Eric Godoi

Reviewer at G2

Pipefy gives us the control we need to ensure everyone abides by our rules and policies. **We no longer have to follow up with people to get all the information we need** to process a purchase request.

Mauricio Rizzi

Customer Service and Procurement Manager, at Samsonite

**Pipefy is easy to use and flexible** . It has a database included, reporting, automation. A complete solution. The main problem I solve is to comply by always getting the same results out of the process. Quality is assured.

Luis Fernando Salazar Canas

Regional Manager at Infina Financial Services

We were communicating with our clients by email and manually tracking the progress of each marketing request. Nowadays, **100% of the requests that are captured on Pipefy correctly, are executed correctly.**

Devon Meerholz

Chief Creative and Operations Officer at IMImobile South Africa

Now, when hiring managers submit recruitment requests, **they have to answer a series of questions, such as salary and job requirements.** So when we get the requests, we don’t have to track down missing information.

Renan Souza Lima

Strategic Analyst, HR at Carglass

Questions & Answers
-------------------

If you need help, we are ready to provide guidance and support.

What is Pipefy’s procure-to-pay software?

Pipefy is the procure-to-pay solution for optimizing procurement workflows and unlocking operational efficiency. Build and automate workflows to manage incoming purchase requests, onboard new vendors, and issue payments faster than ever before.

How does Pipefy Procure-to-Pay work?

Pipefy centralizes all procure-to-pay elements – from requests to payment — to deliver frictionless experiences for internal and external users, and eliminates constant toggling between apps, disjointed communication, and inefficient spreadsheets.

What are Pipefy Procure-to-Pay benefits?

With Pipefy, procurement teams can:

*   Bring teams, tools, and systems together in one place. 
*   Simplify request intake, approvals, reviews, vendor management, and payments. 
*   Bridge communication silos between purchasing and accounts payable for more seamless procurement experiences and less confusion or mistakes.

Can I integrate Pipefy Procure-to-Pay with my existing software or tools?

Yes! View and control your entire procurement operation in one place, and ensure information is exchanged error-free between people and tools automatically. With [Pipefy’s custom integrations](https://help.pipefy.com/en/articles/2333367-how-to-use-pipefy-s-app-and-integrations), seamlessly connect to popular software and tools, including:

*   NetSuite
*   Oracle E-Business Suite
*   QuickBooks Online
*   Sage Intacct
*   Sage Live
*   SAP Data
*   SAP On-premise
*   Workday
*   Xero
*   Zoho Invoice
*   Zuora for Salesforce

What is a Pipefy use case for procure-to-pay?

Some common procure-to-pay uses include: **Purchasing**

*   Use customizable forms to collect purchase requests in a standardized and structured manner. Add mandatory form fields to ensure all request requirements are met every time — no follow-up necessary.
*   Automatically turn purchase requests into cards for approval, and automatically assign approvers and set review SLAs.
*   Portals to group purchase and accounts payable forms in one standardized and secure place for external and internal stakeholders to quickly submit requests. In addition, stakeholders can access key information like policies, request forms, and more.
*   Create audit reports without losing any details or information along the way.

**Accounts Payable**

*   Automate deadline alerts and approval flows to exchange information with responsible agencies or vendors on time. This will enable you to cash in on early payment discounts, and prevent late fees.
*   Organize invoices and send receipts to procurement, requesters, and vendors.
*   Automatically register a transaction with an accounting platform with custom integrations.

**Vendor Registration and Contract Analysis**

*   Connect and import vendor databases for error-free payments.
*   Create self-service workflows for vendor registration, updates, and onboarding.
*   Keep up with approval cycle times, department expenses, and vendor performance with customizable dashboards.
*   Track internal and external contract approvals, modifications, and periodically audit contract management processes.

What is the difference between procure-to-pay and procurement software?

While these are two different processes with different scopes, procurement software is typically used to manage the procure-to-pay process. That’s because procure-to-pay falls under the wider procurement management umbrella. Pipefy automates and digitizes the entire procure-to-pay cycle, making it easier to manage and analyze spending, contracts, and vendors.

Is procure-to-pay and accounts payable software the same thing?

Accounts payable software streamlines and automates business payment processes to reduce manual tasks and payment errors. Procure-to-pay software helps procurement teams manage their entire purchasing process by creating a seamless flow between purchase requests and accounts payable.

What is three-way matching? Can Pipefy do this?

Three-way matching is the process of comparing the purchase order (PO), invoice, and goods received note (GRN) to ensure that the information matches before the invoice is approved and payment is issued to vendors. Pipefy offers features that make three-way matching easy, such as:

*   Mandatory fields for each phase form to validate information and ensure that approvals aren’t granted without the correct information input or processed.
*   Integrations with existing accounting software so information is shared accurately and in real time.
*   Automatic audit trails for each step in the procure-to-pay process for total control and visibility.
*   Optical character recognition technology that turns process-related documents into data. With a solution that reads, analyzes, and processes document contents like humans, processing speed and accuracy increase.

  

How does Pipefy address data security and privacy?

Security and privacy are our top priorities. Here’s how we guarantee compliance, governance, and security across our platform:

*   SOC2 certified and AWS qualified.
*   Meets LDAP, ISO 27001, ISO 27018, and ISO 27701 standards.
*   Multi- and single-tenant hosting options.
*   Active monitoring and backups in place to recover information if anything happens within our environment.
*   Audit logs for all activity on the platform using DataDog for analysis and S3.
*   99.9% or higher uptime.
*   SSO, 2FA, and permission management.
*   All data within Pipefy is encrypted in transit and at rest using 256-bit encryption.

Everything IT teams need. Everything business teams want.  
**Just a prompt away.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build any workflow in minutes with AI
-------------------------------------

Build, automate, and manage every workflow with a single tool built for business teams.

Coding → Low/No-code → Typing

It doesn’t get any easier than this. AI creates workflows using natural language, prompts, and an intuitive user interface.

Automate and deliver more, faster than ever
-------------------------------------------

Avoid errors, cut lead times, and reduce manual work by 40% with process automation and AI.

Automate away

AI automates repetitive manual tasks including data extraction, image recognition, emails, status updates, invoice matching, approvals, and more.

Deliver exceptional service

From intake to approval, AI improves user experiences by answering common questions, centralizing documents and information, and helping users submit and track their requests.

Conserve resources

Automation enables business teams to make better use of their time. And when business teams build more of their own workflows – up to 85% of them – IT has more time for strategy, security, and innovation.

-----------------------------------------

Stay agile with tools that make it easy to measure performance – and even easier to pivot.

Continuous optimization

Use AI to monitor workflows, analyze performance, and track KPIs. Real-time data and deeper insights enable better (and faster) decision-making.

![Image 38](https://assets-site.staticpipefy.com/production/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bgOptimize.png)

Data-driven decisions

Instantly identify root causes, spot trends, and discover new ways to improve any workflow or process.

![Image 39](https://assets-site.staticpipefy.com/production/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tab7.png)

Rapid prototyping

Stay agile and keep pace with evolving business needs. With AI, go from concept to deployment in a fraction of the time vs. hand coding.

Questions & Answers
-------------------

If you need help, we are ready to provide guidance and support.

Do I need any advanced technical skills or professional support services to implement Pipefy?

Pipefy is designed to be simple and easy, allowing anyone to configure their own processes and workflows. However, in large and complex operations some companies like to have the support of our professional consultants – in this case we can recommend companies that offer those services.

Will my data be private and safe?

Keeping your data secure is a top priority at Pipefy. Review our security protocols and how your business and customer data will be protected in our security whitepaper.

What if I need to add someone new to my team?

If you need to add new members, you can do that. The amount charged per new user will be the same for the other members included in your plan. [See our article for more information](https://help.pipefy.com/en/articles/619504-pipefy-pricing-policies).

Can I change plans anytime I want? How long are the contracts?

The contracts can be monthly or yearly. You can start/stop or make changes to your plan any time you want – however, we won’t give refunds for cancellation or plan downgrades. [See our article for more information](https://help.pipefy.com/en/articles/614618-how-to-cancel-a-pipefy-subscription).

Cost optimization

Do more with less
-----------------

Create a unified ecosystem

Get more from your existing stack through workflow orchestration. 300+ native connectors and API integrations dissolve data silos and enable end-to-end automation and visibility.

Deliver more to the business line

Pipefy improves FTE productivity by reducing the IT backlog and making more time and bandwidth available for business line deliverables, service requests, and IT strategy.

Questions & Answers
-------------------

If you need help, we are ready to provide guidance and support.

What is Pipefy Human Resources (HR) Service Delivery?

Our HR Service Delivery platform is an essential component of a no-code Business Process Automation (BPA) tool that optimizes and simplifies business processes. HR processes include payroll and benefits, ongoing development, onboarding and offboarding employees, and the delivery and resolution of employees’ HR service requests.

How does Pipefy HR Service Delivery compare to other HR platforms?

Pipefy is an ideal choice for businesses seeking a flexible tool to design and manage custom HR workflows. Because Pipefy is a no-code BPA platform that optimizes many different types of business processes, however, our tool has features and capabilities that traditional HR software simply can’t offer. These features include multiple department integrations, customizable forms, and user-friendly dashboards, all in a platform requiring no previous coding knowledge.

How can I build and maintain effective HR Service Delivery with Pipefy?

Pipefy’s HR service delivery solution allows HR teams to create workflows without prior coding knowledge. Simply choose a template or start from scratch to build customized automated processes.

How does the software integrate with existing HR systems within the company?

Pipefy’s HR Service Delivery platform fully integrates with payroll systems, HCM, ERPs, and employee databases. It also seamlessly connects key HR processes like hiring and benefits enrollment to the apps your HR team uses each day. These apps include DocuSign, LinkedIn, and Slack.

How does Pipefy address data security and privacy?

Pipefy’s customers’ privacy and data security are our chief concerns. We comply with Information Security best practices and employ a dedicated security team to ensure our environments are safe and secure. Pipefy also uses third-party services to continuously monitor for network vulnerabilities. For more information about our commitment, visit the [security and privacy page](https://www.pipefy.com/security/).
