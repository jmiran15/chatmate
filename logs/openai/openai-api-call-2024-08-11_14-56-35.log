     - Product name (be as specific as possible, including any version numbers if applicable)
     - Tagline (the main slogan or catchphrase used to describe the product)
     - Short description (a concise overview of what the product does)
     - Unique selling proposition (what sets this product apart from competitors)
     - Primary use case (the main problem this product solves or its primary function)
     - Key features (important capabilities or aspects of the product)

     - Pricing plans (all available pricing tiers and what they include)
     - Integrations (other tools or services this product can work with)
     - Support options (ways users can get help or assistance)
  
  3. Use verbatim quotes from the provided content. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or infer information not explicitly stated.
  
  4. Include the exact source URL for each piece of extracted information. If a piece of information appears on multiple pages, include all relevant URLs.
  
  5. Be thorough: look for information in all parts of the website content, including navigation menus, footers, and any linked pages provided.
  
  6. If you cannot find information for a category, explicitly state "No information found" for that category.

Active user billing
-------------------

Freedcamp aims to always offer the most affordable and transparent pricing and billing. Our **Active User Warning System** helps you keep costs down by providing you an accurate count of the active user count over your last billing period. This allows you to lower the number of seats purchased and in turn your next months' bill. Check [Billing FAQ](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/uGeab) to learn more.  
  
We have Read-Only and Guest roles - 'collaborators', which are perfect for clients and those people in your organization who only need to observe work and/or occasionally comment. Users invited as collaborators are not counted as active users and are free on our premium plans making Freedcamp even more affordable and easy to adopt. These permissions are perfect for involving contractors, clients, and teammates from other departments absolutely for free.

Freedcamp for the People
------------------------

We are on a mission to help those who may not be able to afford expensive collaboration tools, but still want to stay productive. Freedcamp supports thousands of good cause organizations, teachers, and students across 85 countries.  
  
Are you a student, teacher, or part of a non profit and want to use Freedcamp to collaborate on projects? Eligibility requirements are explained in more detail in the Freedcamp [for Nonprofits FAQ](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/yDbab) and the Freedcamp [for Education FAQ](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/xDbab).

World Class Support = Happy Customers!
--------------------------------------

Karlo K. New South Wales, Australia

Lemme ask you something. I ask you for support quite often (mostly because of my own ignorance). But you guys always come back to me with the answer and the fix. HOW COME BIG COMPANIES LIKE IBM AND MICROSOFT CAN'T DO THAT??????

👍 Thinks Freedcamp offers **the smoothest ride** in comparison to other project management systems.

Tracy R. Tracy, Kentucky, USA

My team uses Freedcamp. It relies on a robust community of users, reviewers and stakeholders to provide excellent innovation and strong customer service.

🎉 Uses Freedcamp mostly to “keep her complicated life on track.”

Allison G. Allison, Colorado, USA

In terms of Customer Service, Freedcamp is outstanding. They truly want the product to be the best it can be and respond to the customer as a valuable asset to making the product better. I have communicated many times with their Customer Service folks and stand amazed that they care so much about their product and those using it.

🙌 “LITERALLY has never had a piece of software work so flawlessly”

  Freedcamp Public API
===============

Freedcamp Public API
====================

Table of Contents

[](https://freedcamp.com/Mobile_7Yh/iOS_application_6zp/wiki/wiki_public/view/DFaab#)

Description
===========

This wiki describes Freedcamp public API things.

API end point: [](https://test.freedcamp.com/api/v1/)[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/).  
[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) [collection](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account/api/postman_collection) which contains ready-to-go requests.  
[Usage example](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account/api/api_example_script) (PHP).

Setup
=====

To setup API for you please:

[![Image 1](https://freedcampfilestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/image-25561.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI56FRGV4ETJQCNMQ&Expires=1723661779&Signature=ipE%2B7lRBTCGSiYc%2BpTw1THCisBk%3D)](https://freedcampfilestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/image-25561.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI56FRGV4ETJQCNMQ&Expires=1723661779&Signature=ipE%2B7lRBTCGSiYc%2BpTw1THCisBk%3D "image.png")

1 - go to [My Account/Integrations/API](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account#integrations)

2 - generate a new API key

3 - to access this page

Authentification
================

You may generate API keys on the [Integrations/API tab on My Account page](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account#integrations). There are two types of keys: secured by API secret and not secured (you may change the type when you want). We highly recommend to use Secured keys for your needs when possible, but for quick testing, you may want to omit additional security.

Not secured API keys
--------------------

Just pass the api\_key with the key value as a GET or POST parameter, for example:

https:// freedcamp.com/api/v1/sessions/current?api\_key=api\_key

Not secured API keys have expiration time in one week. This can be changed later.

Note that anyone who has access to your active not secured API key can do most of the actions available via API. **NEVER** share unsecured API key with anyone. If you suspect a key leak, please convert the key to the secured with API secret or delete it. We'll forbid some types of actions (like project or account deletion) for not secured keys soon.

**Zapier API keys**
-------------------

These keys are used for [Zapier](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/aGcab) integration. These keys will only work for Zapier requests. Note that anyone who has access to your Zapier API key is also able to connect to your Freedcamp data with Zapier. These keys also have restricted permissions.

Secured API keys
----------------

To auth with these keys, except the key itself you need to also pass a timestamp and hash parameters. A timestamp is the request timestamp (check you have properly set time on your server), and a hash is calculated using API secret in this way (PHP code for example):

$hash = hash\_hmac('sha1', $api\_key . $timestamp, $api\_secret);

So the request will look like:

https:// freedcamp.com/api/v1/sessions/current?api\_key=api\_key&timestamp=current\_ts&hash=your\_hash

Get your API secret on the [API tab on My Account page](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account#manage_api) (you will need to enter your password). **NEVER** share API secret with anyone and do not pass it publicly. Let us know if you suspect API secret key leak.  
Please check the "Calculating hash for secured API key" chapter below for more details.

Passing API key in the header
-----------------------------

To not pass the API key as an URL parameter or inside POST body you may pass it via X-API-KEY header. This approach is used in requests in Postman collection.

Other methods
-------------

We plan to implement Oauth2 auth later on.

Examples
========

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) [collection](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account/api/postman_collection) which contains ready-to-go requests. Check "Setting up Postman" section below for details.  
[Usage example](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account/api/api_example_script) (PHP).

Request
-------

If a request should be done with any non-GET parameters (except auth parameters), it's supposed that they are passed as a form-data parameter with name 'data' and JSON-encoded value.

**Example:**

data: {"email": "test@email.com", "password": "11111111"}

You may pass your auth credentials as POST data as well as in the GET with payload:

api\_key: api\_key
timestamp: current\_ts
hash: your\_hash
data: {"email": "test@email.com", "password": "11111111"}

### PUT requests

All "update" requests which are described as **PUT** below should use **POST** requests. "Update" requests differ from "add" requests by passing id of the modified item. Later we may support PUT requests for updates.

Response
--------

Each response returns JSON-encoded JS object with the following fields:

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| http\_code | duplicates HTTP code passed in headers. |
| msg | 'OK' on successful request, an error description otherwise. |
| error\_id | in the case when an error occurred and was logged by API, will contain corresponding error\_id you can use to refer to in your support request to Freedcamp. |
| maintenance (can be absent) | in the case when there is active or upcoming Freedcamp maintenance scheduled (see Maintenance below). |
| data | specific for the request data, empty if an error happened or nothing to return. If there were some errors to show to a user, they will be placed under "errors" field. errors.general means some general error, errors.\_some\_filed\_name\_ - means that error is for some posted field (like validation error). |

Examples of unsuccessful requests responses:

{
  "http\_code": 500,
  "msg": "Server error occurred.",
  "error\_id": 1621951,
  "data": \[errors: {"general": "Server error occurred, please try onу more time."}\]
}

{
  "http\_code": 401,
  "msg": "Wrong credentials",
  "error\_id": 0,
  "data": \[\]
}

{
  "http\_code": 404,
  "msg": "Unknown method",
  "error\_id": 0,
  "data": \[\]
}

Maintenance
-----------

When API endpoint is in the maintenance mode or there is upcoming maintenance, API, in addition to standard fields (msg, data, etc.), returns **maintenance** field on each request, which has the next fields:

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| start\_ts | a timestamp of maintenance start |
| duration | the planned duration of the maintenance in minutes. A client should use it to inform users about planned time for service recovery ( which can be calculated as \[_start\_ts + duration \* 60\]_). The actual duration can be less than this value (if we finished maintenance sooner). Duration value may increase during the maintenance but has a low probability. |
| msg | a string with additional info for users about maintenance reasons. It can be empty. If it is not empty, should be shown somehow to the users in the client message about maintenance |
| start\_ts | a timestamp of maintenance start |
| duration | the planned duration of the maintenance in minutes. A client should use it to inform users about planned time for service recovery ( which can be calculated as _\[start\_ts + duration \* 60\]_). The actual duration can be less than this value )if we finished maintenance sooner). Duration value may increase during the maintenance but has a low probability. |
|  |  |

Example:

  "maintenance": {
    "start\_ts": 1479848400,
    "duration": 60,
    "msg": ""
  }

Usually, maintenance field is being sent 60 minutes before the maintenance.

If Freedcamp AOI endpoint is already in the maintenance mode, it returns HTTP 503 in headers (and still returns the maintenance field):

{
  "http\_code": 503,
  "msg": "Maintenance is in progress",
  "error\_id": 0,
  "maintenance": {
    "start\_ts": 1479848400,
    "duration": 60,
    "msg": ""
  },
  "data": {}
}

No actions were executed if API endpoint returned 503.

**A client should not** send requests more often than one per minute while getting 503 in response.

It's possible that web-interface is in maintenance mode and API endpoint is not and vice versa.

Common filtration and ordering
==============================

For some endpoints fetching the application items (like /tasks, /times, /issues, etc.) except the way described in the chapters, there is a hack - a quick way to get several filters combination for your API request:

1\. Open the application on freedcamp.com (web UI).  
2\. Apply all needed filters and order.  
3\. Copy url with applied filters:

[![Image 2](https://freedcampfilestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/image-38273.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI56FRGV4ETJQCNMQ&Expires=1723661779&Signature=oM44xHfCMJNPbr6K5PpxEnOpFzU%3D)](https://freedcampfilestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/image-38273.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI56FRGV4ETJQCNMQ&Expires=1723661779&Signature=oM44xHfCMJNPbr6K5PpxEnOpFzU%3D "image.png")  
4\. Extract GET parameters and add them to your API request:  
[![Image 3](https://freedcampfilestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/image-11148.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI56FRGV4ETJQCNMQ&Expires=1723661779&Signature=jYF%2BAyA7TeMMob%2BnywiiKSfYpvQ%3D)](https://freedcampfilestorage.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorials/image-11148.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI56FRGV4ETJQCNMQ&Expires=1723661779&Signature=jYF%2BAyA7TeMMob%2BnywiiKSfYpvQ%3D "image.png")

Supported methods
=================

/sessions
---------

Used to start a new session, get information about a current session or close a current session.  
Sessions are identified by a session token. Each device has own token with TTL of 1 week after the last action done in this session.  
If you have no active token when setting up the session, a new token will be created and returned, otherwise, the old one will be returned.

### GET

Only /sessions/current will work.  
Returns the same data as POST request returns except for a token.

### POST

WARNING: Is not supported now

Returns session token and all info needed for the initial screen if valid email/password are passed. X-API-TOKEN should be empty. HTTP code 401 will be returned if a user can't be logged in using given credentials.

**Input data:** email, password, oauth\_provider, oauth\_access\_token

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| email | should be always present except when signing in via Twitter which does not provide us with user's email |

/projects
---------

### GET

/projects - returns the same data as /sessions/current:GET request returns except user\_id. You may pass "f\_recent\_projects\_ids=1" GET parameter, then the response will contain 'recent\_project\_ids' array with recently visited projects ids (the same as on projects dashboard). Order is from most recently visited to less recently. Only projects visited using web UI are marked as recent. Avoid using f\_recent\_projects\_ids too often (for example more than once an hour).

/projects/project\_id - returns the same data as /sessions/current:GET request returns except:

1) user\_id is not returned;

2) "projects" array contains only specified project (or it's empty if a project is not found)

3) project inside "projects" array has additional field "notifications", containing all unread notifications. See /notifications for "notifications" structure description.

4) project inside "projects" array has an additional field "f\_subtasks\_adv", containing boolean true or false. It reflects if a user is able to create advanced subtasks in the project.

5) project inside "projects" array has an additional field "f\_can\_add\_tasks", containing boolean true or false. It reflects if a user is able to create tasks in the project.

/invitations
------------

### GET

/invitations - returns the list of all user's pending invitations to projects. Each element contains group\_name, project\_name, hash, and invited\_by\_user fields.

invited\_by\_user has the same structure as user array structure returned by /users:GET request. Note that email is always NULL.

The API endpoint returns extended data (instead of just project\_id and invited\_by\_id) as a user is not yet a part of any project. Information for such invited user can't be obtained by standard /projects and /users requests.

Example:

"invitations": \[
      {
        "group\_name": "Some group",
        "project\_name": "Some project",

        }
      }
    \]

### PUT

{
	"invitations": \[{
		"hash": "bc4fcff30a99d7524ef36855a95f54a8",

### GET

**Input data:**

/users - returns all users visible to the current user

/users/current - returns current user data

/users/user\_id  - returns "users" array containing only specified user data, if the current user has permissions to see him. Empty "users" array otherwise

        "first\_name": "fsdc",
        "last\_name": "sdcd",
        "avatar\_url": "https:\\\\/\\\\/freedcamp-avatars-test.s3.amazonaws.com\\\\/4b33322be59237277135526b97d1e86de2.jpg",
        "full\_name": "f s.",
        "email": null,

| password  | can be empty in a case when oauth\_provider parameter is passed |
| first\_name | required |
| last\_name  | can be empty |
| oauth\_provider | if a user has done an unsuccessful login attempt using OAuth provider previously, an app may fill this field and oauth\_access\_token field with appropriate data to get user linked with the provider right after the registration. If OAuth provider has provided the app with email and first name, you can directly issue this request with an empty password (will be generated on the server side) without displaying a register screen to the user. Note that in case of returned errors (like empty email field) these errors will still correspond to register screen. A field can be empty or absent. |
| oauth\_access\_token | should be present if oauth\_provider is set, can be empty or absent otherwise |
| mobile\_app\_version | a version of the mobile app |

As to the avatar attached - please note, the maximum available square portion of the image will be used as an avatar (will be used the central part of the image), and it will be resized to 100\*100 px.

X-API-TOKEN should be empty.

Example:

data: {"email": "bear+ss@deepshiftlabs.com", "password": "1111111111", "first\_name": "fname", "last\_name": "sdc"}

avatar: binary file data\*

\* i. e. request body contains 2 fields, string "data" and file "avatar", encoded as a form-data

**Output:** the same as /sessions:POST returns

### PUT

**(**actual request should be **/users/current:POST**)

**Input data:**

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| email | can be empty or absent. If present and differes from the current one, confirmation\_password should be passed. |
| password  | SHOULD be empty or absent if user does not change it. If passed, confirmation\_password should be passed also. |
|  |  |
| first\_name | It can not be empty |
| last\_name  | It can be empty |
| confirmation\_password | Active password should be passed only when email or/and password are changed |
| timezone | User's timezone. To get a list of available timezones, use /timezones:GET |

To update avatar, use /avatars/current:POST.

Request data example:

{
	"email": "some@freedcamp.com",
	"password": "",
	"first\_name": "333",
	"last\_name": "44444",
	"confirmation\_password": "",
	"timezone": "America/New\_York"
}

**Output:** the same as for /users/user\_id:GET, also may contain **token** (see below).

**WARN!** If email and/or password is changed, a user will be logged out from all devices, including the current one (current token becomes invalid). So if a token is returned in the response, an application SHOULD replace the old token with this new one. Output example with a token is below. When different tokens for different sessions are implemented, a token will not become obsolete.

  "data": {
    "users": \[
      {...}
    \],
    "token": "cc76fec61451717732153334d7e986acb380fcb2"
  }

### DELETE

See /wipe for user deletion.

/wipe
-----

/wipe/current

### GET

WARN: Not allowed publicly, for now,

is used to get information about the account before deleting it. Currently, it returns the only flag f\_password\_needed.

**Output data:**

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| f\_password\_needed | true or false. Not active or accounts created recently can be deleted w/o password confirmation, so you should check f\_password\_needed and do not ask the user for a password confirmation if it's false. |

Output example:

  "data": {
    "f\_password\_needed": true
  }

### POST

WARN: Not allowed publicly for now

is used to delete a user account and all linked data

**Input data:**

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| password  | confirmation password. It can be empty or absent if f\_password\_needed returned by /wipe:GET is false |

Input example:

    {"password": "11111111"}

/password\_reset\_emails
------------------------

### POST

If successful, an email to the given email will be sent with the reset key inside which should be used in /passwords:POST request then

**Input data:** email

Example:

{"email": "xxx@xxxxx.com"}

**Output** (inside 'data'):

**msg:** Message you may show to the user, like "Reset key has been sent to xxx@xxx.com"

/passwords

Allows to set a new password using reset password key sent by issuing /password\_reset\_emails:POST request

### POST

**Input data:**

**password:** new password.

| --- | --- |
| reset\_key | password reset key from the email |

Example:

{"password": "11111111", "reset\_key": "xxx"}

/avatars
--------

### POST

I plan to use only POST requests for all actions related to files uploading because of PUT limitations in PHP when working with files. That's why avatar update is not under the /users/current:PUT request.

**Input data:**

form FILE field - binary avatar file (not inside the data parameter with JSON)

example:

avatar: binary file data\*

\* request body should be encoded as a form-data

**Output:**

**avatar:** an object which contains a new avatar URL. Example:

    "avatar": {
      "avatar\_url": "https:\\\\/\\\\/freedcamp-avatars-test.s3.amazonaws.com\\\\/4b322be59235557135526b97d1e86de2.jpg"

}

/validations
------------

### GET

/notifications/email - checks if email used for an invitation is valid and does not exist in the project, also returns avatar URL if check passed. Probably these actions will be split/moved to different API URLs after discussions.

"email" in URL means a type of validation.

**Input:**

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| email | email to validate |
| project\_id | optional. If set, an output will contain an error if the email is already present in the project users |

Request example:

    data:   {"email": "", "project\_id": "423242"}

**Output:**

**avatar\_url** - on success

Example:

    "avatar\_url": "https://freedcamp-avatars-test.s3.amazonaws.com/534d29407bfce199827779dbb4b4a3c8e\_6eabef.png"

/tasks
------

### GET

/tasks - returns a list of all tasks user has access to

/tasks/?project\_id=xxx - list of tasks in the project

/tasks/task\_id - list of tasks which contains only the task with given task\_id

**Custom fields**

To include custom fields data in the response you need to add "f\_cf=1" parameter, example: /tasks/?project\_id=xxx&f\_cf=1. Only fetch is supported for custom fields (no insert/update/delete). When you pass f\_cf=1, the response will contain an additional array of custom fields templates used in the resulting task list.

**Tags**

You may pass "f\_include\_tags=1" GET parameter, then the response will contain 'tags' array with tag ids assigned to the item.

**Limits**

All /tasks:GET requests support limit and offset parameters. Example: "/tasks?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200.

All responses contain "meta" field:

    "meta": {
        "has\_more": true, // always presents
        "total\_count": 1362 // presents if has\_more = true
    }

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| has\_more | is true if there are more results after the last returned result in the response, and false otherwise. |
| total\_count | presents if show\_more = true and contains all available results count. |

WARN: currently limit, offset, total\_count values are applied to the **top-level** tasks. All subtasks are ignored when a limit is applied, and total\_count is calculated.

**Example**

To fetch all the tasks, you need to execute set of requests like

[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=0](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=0)  
[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=200](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=200)  
[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=400](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/tasks?limit=200&offset=400)  
....

while there are results or meta.has\_more is true.  
Each request may return more than 200 tasks, if there are subtasks. All subtasks of the task are always returned in the one request (are not split between pages).

**Filtration and order**

/tasks and /tasks/?project\_id=xxx requests support filtration and ordering. Filters/order can be applied in any combination.

Supported filters:

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| status | check [constants wiki](https://freedcamp.com/Mobile_7Yh/iOS_application_6zp/wiki/wiki_public/view/AHaab) for possible values. For example, to get only not started and started tasks, you should use:  "/tasks?status\[\]=0&status\[\]=2" |
| assigned\_to\_id | accepts integer values containing user id or one of Assignments constants from [constants wiki](https://freedcamp.com/Mobile_7Yh/iOS_application_6zp/wiki/wiki_public/view/AHaab) |
| created\_by\_id | accepts integer values containing user id |
| due\_date\[from\] | accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the due date set and due date >= due\_date\[from\] will be returned |
| due\_date\[to\] | accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the due date set and due date <= due\_date\[to\] will be returned |
| created\_date\[from\] | accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the creation date >= created\_date\[from\] will be returned |
| created\_date\[to\] | accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only tasks with the creation date <= created\_date\[to\] will be returned |
| f\_with\_archived | accepts 1/0 values. If 1 is passed, tasks from archived projects will be included to the response. If omitted or 0 is passed, only tasks from active projects are fetched.
 |
| lists\_status | Determines the status (i.e. active or archived) of Task Lists to fetch tasks from.  Accepts "active", "archived", "all" values. Omitting is equal to "active".  
(Note: "Task list" is the new name for "Task Group". The old name is still used in API and this wiki).

 |

Supported orders:

**priority:** tasks with no priority set are supposed to have the lowest priority.  
**due\_date**: tasks with no due date set are always placed at the list end despite the order direction.

WARN: if there are many orders in the request, only the first one will be applied.  
WARN: ordering is applied to Tasks groups for all orders except due\_date. So if you have two tasks groups in output, there will be all tasks from the first group, and then all tasks from the second group in the output. For due\_date order, Tasks groups order is ignored.  
WARN: when ordering, subtasks are always following their parent tasks if these tasks are present in the output.

If not valid filter or order value is passed, this value is ignored.

Example: /tasks?status\[\]=0&due\_date\[from\]=2017-02-01&due\_date\[to\]=2017-02-28&created\_date\[from\]=2017-01-01&&assigned\_to\_id\[\]=13&assigned\_to\_id\[\]=-1&assigned\_to\_id\[\]=0&created\_by\_id\[\]=15&order\[due\_date\]=asc&lists\_status=active

Output example for /tasks:GET:

**Output:**

**tasks****:** list of tasks with the next fields:

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| id | task id |
| assigned\_to\_id | user id task is assigned to. May have values -1 (ASSIGNED\_EVERYONE) and 0 (ASSIGNED\_NOONE). |
| created\_by\_id | user id who created the task |
| task\_group\_id |  |
| project\_id |  |
| priority | possible values: 0 (none), 1 (low), 2 (medium), 3 (high). |
| title |  |
| description | raw description, with Freedcamp tags like \[fcattach\]. WARN - you should show this data to the user when editing. |
| description\_processed | (absent if it's not a get one task by id) processed description, where \[fcattach\] tags are replaced with actual images with link. WARN - is present only when you request only one task, absent otherwise. You should show to user this data when showing task (and use raw "description" when editing). |
| status | one of the next values: 0 (not started), 1 (completed), 2 (in progress) |
| comments\_count |  |
| files\_count | files attached to the task (files attached to task comments are not counted) |
| completed\_ts | if was completed, ts when it happened, null otherwise |
| start\_ts | null if it was not set |
| due\_ts | null if it was not set |
| created\_ts |  |
| task\_group\_name |  |
| f\_archived\_list | false if the task is in an active task list, true if the task is in an archived task list |
| priority\_title | a title of the corresponding value in 'priority' field |
| status\_title | title of the corresponding value in 'status' field |
| assigned\_to\_fullname | name of a user task is assigned to (will be discussed if we need it and in what format) |
| can\_delete | (absent if a query is for more than one project) |
| can\_edit  | (absent if a query is for more than one project) |
| can\_assign  | (absent if a query is for more than one project) |
| can\_progress  | (absent if a query is for more than one project) |
| can\_comment  | (absent if a query is for more than one project) |
| comments  | (absent if it's not a get task by id) list of comments. Comments structure is described below |
| files | (absent if it's not a get task by id) list of files attached to the task. See /files:GET for structure description |
| url | URL for the task |
| cf\_tpl\_id | custom fields template id (if linked with the task) |
| custom\_fields | (absent if custom fields are not requested) an array of custom fields values used for the task |
| h\_level | shows the task nesting level, 0 for top-level tasks. |
|  |  |
| h\_parent\_id | shows the parent task id. Is an empty string for top-level tasks. |
| h\_top\_id | shows the top parent task id (so is equal to h\_parent\_id for subtasks with h\_level=1, and differs for subtasks with h\_level > 1). Is an empty string for top-level tasks. |
| r\_rule | empty if the task is not recurring |
| order | set by user order inside tasks group (using d&d). By default tasks in output are ordered by this field inside their tasks groups.WARN! It's possible that several tasks inside the same group have the same order value including default value (0).
WARN! It's possible that subtask has order equal to or greater than its parent(s). In this case, API ignores the order of subtask and places subtask after parent task (if a parent is present in output).

WARN! This field is NOT equal to the task position in the returned list.

 |
| f\_adv\_subtask | (absent if it's not a get one task by id) shows if this is an advanced subtask or not. True for advanced subtasks, false for usual tasks and not advanced subtasks. Advanced subtasks have the same properties (all editable) that usual tasks. Not advanced subtasks have title and status only, and status can be set only in "TODO\_NOT\_STARTED" or "TODO\_COMPLETED" (no "TODO\_IN\_PROGRESS" status).  Not advanced subtasks can't have comments as well. It's possible for a user to have access to both advanced and not advanced subtasks at the same time even inside the same project. |

**Example:**

    "tasks": \[
      {
        "id": "1528",
        "h\_parent\_id": "1525",

      },
      ....
    \]

Comments structure: the same as /comments:POST returns.

If custom fields data is requested and there were custom fields templates linked to some tasks in the list, list of these templates will be returned in a separate array "cf\_templates".  
Here is an example of its structure:

"cf\_templates": \[
    {
        "id": "17",
        "title": "all fields",
        "fields": \[
            {

                "title": "drop very long name",
                "type": "dropdown",
                "f\_required": false,
                "order": 0,
                "dd\_options": \[
                    "the first option",
                    "the second option",
                \]
            },
            {
                "id": "1",
                "title": "text",
                "type": "text\_field",
                "f\_required": false,
                "order": 1,
                "dd\_options": null
            },
            {
                "id": "2",
                "title": "area",
                "type": "textarea",
                "f\_required": false,
                "order": 2,
                "dd\_options": null
            },
            {
                "id": "19",
                "title": "check",
                "type": "checkbox",
                "f\_required": false,
                "order": 3,
                "dd\_options": null
            },
            {
                "id": "18",
                "title": "numn",
                "type": "number",
                "f\_required": false,
                "order": 4,
                "dd\_options": null
            },
            {
                "id": "17",
                "title": "date",
                "type": "date",
                "f\_required": false,
                "order": 5,
                "dd\_options": null
            }
        \]
    }
\]

dd\_options array contains values for the dropdown type of custom field. For other field types, this field is set to null. Inside "custom\_fields" array with values for the task, **value** for the field with dropdown type is the number of the value in the dd\_options array (starting from 0). Also for dropdowns, there is an additional field **dd\_actual\_value** which contains the actual value (so you may know it without extracting it from dd\_options by id).

### POST

**Input data:**

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| title |  |
| description  | can be an empty string |
| project\_id |  |
| task\_group\_id | can be empty or absent (task will be added to the first task list). |
| priority  | priority id. See priorities for :get. |
| assigned\_to\_id | should contain assigned to user id OR one of the two constants:  -1 (ASSIGNED\_EVERYONE) and 0 (ASSIGNED\_NOONE) |
| start\_date  | can be empty or absent, the format is YYYY-MM-DD (empty value will be used if start\_date is not allowed for the plan. Old start\_date will be overridden in this case, if any). |
| r\_rule | the recurrence rule in [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) ([RFC 5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)) format, can be an empty string or absent |
| due\_date  | can be empty or absent, the format is YYYY-MM-DD |
| attached\_ids  | an array of files uploaded previously with temporary=1 flag |
| item\_parent\_id  | can be absent or empty. It contains a parent task id. Note: parent task should be in the same tasks group as passed task\_group\_id. WARN! if a project, where subtask is added to, does not allow advanced subtasks (i.e. has f\_subtasks\_adv = false, see above), added subtask should contain empty string for description and due\_date fields, and "0" for priority and assigned\_to\_id fields. Also, the parent task should not be a subtask. In case when other values are passed, they will be implicitly fixed to the right values with triggering an error sent to Freedcamp developers. |

Request example:

{"title": "22222", "description": "wwwwwww", "project\_id": "305", "task\_group\_id": "272", "priority": "1", "assigned\_to\_id": "1", "due\_date": "2015-08-28", "r\_rule": "RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5", "attached\_ids": \[1296, 1297\]}

**Output:** the same as /tasks/task\_id:GET

### PUT

**(**actual request should be **/tasks/task\_id:POST**)

**WARN!** If an edited task is a subtask (h\_parent\_id is not empty) and has f\_adv\_subtask = false, edited data should contain empty string for **description** and **due\_date** fields, and "0" for **priority** and **assigned\_to\_id** fields, or these fields should be absent. Also, the parent task should not be a subtask. No limits if f\_adv\_subtask = true.

**Input data:**

The same set as for /tasks:POST. You may pass only changed parameters as well and skip passing not changed.

**item\_parent\_id** \- can be absent or empty. If it is absent, the current parent id value is not changed during the query. If it is not empty and the edited task is not a subtask, it becomes a subtask. If is empty and edited task is a subtask, it becomes a task. All children tasks of the edited task are still its children in any case. Note: parent task should be in the same tasks group as passed **task\_group\_id**.

Request data example:

{"title": "QQrgfbQQfdvQ!!!!", "description": "dvsdvdsfvdfv", "task\_group\_id": "276", "priority": "2", "assigned\_to\_id": "123", "due\_date": "2015-08-13", "status": "2", "attached\_ids": \[1296, 1297\]}

**Output:** the same as /tasks/task\_id:GET

### /tasks:POST(PUT) with custom fields manipulation

With usual data passed when adding a task, you may pass additional fields:

"cf\_tpl\_id": 1, "custom\_fields": \[{"cf\_id": "1", "value": "1"}, {"cf\_id": "2", "value": "some text"}\]

Custom fields data structure is described in [/tasks:GET](https://freedcamp.com/Mobile_7Yh/iOS_application_6zp/wiki/2581#get_fcu_9) section above.

**Warn** - **do not pass 'cf\_tpl\_id' and 'custom\_fields'** if you do not intend to actually change anything in custom fields. Only passed custom fields values will be updated.

Request data example to unlink custom field template from a task:

**/tasks/task\_id:PUT**

{"cf\_tpl\_id": null}

### DELETE

/tasks/task\_id:DELETE

/milestones
-----------

### GET

/milestones- returns a list of all milestones user has access to

/milestones?project\_id=xxx - list of milestones in the project

/milestones/milestone\_id - list of milestones which contains only the milestone with given milestone\_id

**Limits**

All /milestones:GET requests support limit and offset parameters. Example: "/milestones?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200.

All responses contain "meta" field:

    "meta": {
        "has\_more": true, // always presents
        "total\_count": 1362 // presents if has\_more = true
    }

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| has\_more | is true if there are more results after the last returned result in the response, and false otherwise. |
| total\_count | presents if show\_more = true and contains all available results count. |

**Example**

To fetch all the milestones, you need to execute a set of requests like

[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=0](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=0)  
[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=200](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=200)  
[https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=400](https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/milestones?limit=200&offset=400)  
....

while there are results or meta.has\_more is true.

**Filtration and order**

If you need more filters and orders please contact support.

### PUT

**(**actual request should be **/comments/comment\_id:POST**)

**Input data:**

If you allow your users to edit comments you should be using **description** field not **description\_processed** field. Field **description\_processed**  should not be exposed for editing directly as it does not contain meta-information required which may get erased and lead to some data loss if PUT back.

The same as for /comments:POST

### DELETE

/comments/comment\_id

Deletes the comment.

/issues
-------

### GET

/issues - returns a list of all issues user has access to

/issues/?project\_id=xxx - list of issues in the project

/issues/issue\_id - list of issues which contains only the issue with given issue\_id

**Tags**

You may pass "f\_include\_tags=1" GET parameter, then the response will contain 'tags' array with tag ids assigned to the item.

**Limits**

All /issues:GET requests support limit and offset parameters. Example: "/issues?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200.

| has\_more | is true if there are more results than there were returned in the response, and false otherwise. |
| total\_count | presents if show\_more = true and contains all available results. |

**Filtration and order**

/issues and /issues/?project\_id=xxx requests support filtration and ordering. Filters/order can be applied in any combination.

Supported filters:

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| type | possible values are: "Bug", "Cosmetics", "Exception", "Feature", "Task", "Usability", "Performance", "Auto-Reported". For example, to get only Features, you should use:  "/issues?type\[\]=feature" |
| priority | possible values are: 1, 2, 3. For example, to get only high priority issues, you should use:  "/issues?priority\[\]=3" |
| status | possible values are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ("Open", "Completed", "InProgress", "Invalid", "Review"). For example, to get only open and invalid issues, you should use:  "/issues?status\[\]=0&status\[\]=3" |
| assigned\_to\_id | accepts integer values containing user id or one of Assignments constants from [constants wiki](https://freedcamp.com/Mobile_7Yh/iOS_application_6zp/wiki/wiki_public/view/AHaab) |

| due\_date\[from\] | accepts a date in format YYYY-MM-DD. If set, only issues with the due date set and due date >= due\_date\[from\] will be returned |
|  |  |

Supported orders:

**due\_date**: issues with no due date set are always placed at the list end despite the order direction.

WARN: if there are many orders in the request, only the first one will be applied.

If not valid filter or order value is passed, this value is ignored and the throttle penalty may be applied.

Example: /issues?type\[\]=feature&priority\[\]=3&status\[\]=0&due\_date\[from\]=2018-09-01&due\_date\[to\]=2018-09-28&assigned\_to\_id\[\]=13&assigned\_to\_id\[\]=-1&assigned\_to\_id\[\]=0&order\[due\_date\]=asc

/backups
--------

### GET

/backups returns all existing backups.

**Limits**

/backups:GET request supports limit and offset parameters. Example: "/backups?limit=2&offset=2". Current default (and maximum allowed) limit for public API is 200. Backups are ordered by date created DESC, so the most recent backups are on top. It's recommended to use reasonable limit to get only last backups, like limit=20.

All responses contain "meta" field:

    "meta": {
        "has\_more": true, // always presents
        "total\_count": 120 // presents if has\_more = true
    }

**has\_more** is true if there are more results than were returned in the response, and false otherwise.  
**total\_count** presents if show\_more = true and contains all available results count.

**Output**

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| id |  |
| date\_human |  |
| url | Authorized S3 URL, expires in 24 hours |

Example:

"backups": \[
    {
        "id": "23422",
        "date\_human": "Oct 2, 2018",
        "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/backup\_2342222\_2018-10-02\_0102.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=JNKJCDNSSDCDCSD&Expires=12143242432&Signature=qqT%2Bey2zW%2B0%2tOC6J2W8i1bN%2BpmI%3D"
    },
    ...
    {
        "id": "23410",
        "date\_human": "Jul 1, 2018",
        "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/backup\_2342342\_2018-07-01\_0102.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=JNKJCDNSSDCDCSD&Expires=12143242432&Signature=qqT%2Bey2zW%2B0%2tOC6J2W8i1bN%2BpmI%3D"

Calculating hash for a secured API key
======================================

Validation tool
---------------

[Simple&rude html page](https://freedcamp.com/cdn/platform/check_api_hash_calc.html) where you can check if your hash is properly calculated (opens in a new tab).

Javascript
----------

var secret = 'your secret API key';
var public\_key = 'your secured public api key';
var ts = new Date().valueOf();
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(public\_key + ts, secret);
var hash\_string = hash.toString(); // send this to API

C#
--

The code below is kindly provided by Freedcamp user [H. Gokhan Mamaci](mailto:gokhan@mamaci.com):

private static readonly Encoding encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
void Main()
{
   var key\_public = "your secured public api key";
   var key\_private = "your secret API key";
   var ts = UnixTimeStampTotalSeconds();
   var keyByte = encoding.GetBytes(key\_private);

   using (var hmacsha1 = new HMACSHA1(keyByte))
   {
         hmacsha1.ComputeHash(encoding.GetBytes(string.Concat(key\_public, ts)));
         var hashstr = ByteToString(hmacsha1.Hash);
         $"https://freedcamp.com/api/v1/sessions/current?api\_key={key\_public}&timestamp={ts}&hash={hashstr}".Dump();
   }
}

static string ByteToString(byte\[\] buff)
{
   string sbinary = "";
   for (int i = 0; i < buff.Length; i++)
       sbinary += buff\[i\].ToString("x2");
   return sbinary;
}

static string UnixTimeStampTotalSeconds()
{
   DateTime nx = new DateTime(1970, 1, 1); // UNIX epoch date
   TimeSpan ts = DateTime.UtcNow - nx;
   return ((long)ts.TotalSeconds).ToString();
}

Setting up Postman
==================

Postman will allow you to easily check and test all the available methods. Note that not all methods in the collection are currently allowed for access through public API (like /wipe).  
To get requests working for the example collection, you need to define 'xapikey' variable in the current Postman environment with the value of your api\_key. No need to define cookie and xapitoken variables so far.  
For a simple start you may use not-secured api\_key - it does not require calculating hash.  
  
If you want to use API key secured with API secret, you should define a pre-request script which will calculate hash based on the current time. You should end up having set up like shown below.

**Url**

{{apihost}}/api/v1/tasks?api\_key={{public\_api\_key}}&timestamp={{timestamp}}&hash={{hash}}&limit=5&offset=0

**Pre-request script**

var public\_api\_key = "your api key";
var secret\_key = "your api secret";
var timestamp = Math.floor(new Date().valueOf()/1000);

var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(public\_api\_key + timestamp, secret\_key);

// lines below will be a bit different for the standalone version - you'll use pm.environment.set("public\_api\_key", public\_api\_key);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("public\_api\_key", public\_api\_key);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("timestamp", timestamp);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("hash", hash.toString());

Attaching files to tasks
------------------------

There are two possible ways to attach a file to a task:

**1)** Create a task. Now upload a file with "temporary=0" field and with proper values for project\_id, app\_id ('2' for Tasks) and item\_id (i.e. task id).

curl -X POST \\
  [http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/files?api\_key=your\_api\_key](http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/files?api_key=your_api_key) \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \\
  -F 'data={"project\_id": "632", "application\_id": "2", "item\_id": "323", "comment\_id": "", "temporary":0}' \\
  -F 'file=@C:\\file.txt'

**2)** Upload file(s) with "temporary=1" field and remember their id (returned in the response). You also need to set application\_id and project\_id.

curl -X POST \\
  [http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/files?api\_key=your\_api\_key](http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/files?api_key=your_api_key) \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \\
  -F 'data={"project\_id": "632", "application\_id": "2", "item\_id": "", "comment\_id": "", "temporary":1}' \\
  -F 'file=@C:\\file.txt'

Returned file id = 1748. Now post a task, passing these id(s) in attached\_ids field:

curl -X POST \\
  [http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/tasks?api\_key=your\_api\_key](http://freedcamp.bear.com/api/v1/tasks?api_key=your_api_key) \\
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \\
  -F 'data={"title": "33333", "description": "wwwwwww", "project\_id": "632", "task\_group\_id": "2599259", "task\_group\_name": "","task\_group\_description": "", "priority": "1", "assigned\_to\_id": "167", "due\_date": "2015-08-28", "attached\_ids":\[1748\]}'
