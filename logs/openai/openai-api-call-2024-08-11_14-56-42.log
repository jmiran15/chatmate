Do more with Tasks
------------------

Empower your team by creating order and staying on track.

Keep track of all your task assignments, activities, and time logs across projects. Use the 'My Work' section to stay on top of all tasks assigned to you, sorted by deadlines.

![Image 15: Start with clarity](https://niftypm.com/_ipx/f_png&q_80&s_1332x668/nimages/nifty-tasks1/large@2x.png)

Never miss a deadline
---------------------
