[system]: We are working on creating a blog post for our web app - for the purposes of SEO and reaching more users organically - who are showing buyer intent. We are working on BoFu blog content - which is bottom of the funnel content - usually for users who are one step away from a final purchase. Our web app is called Chatmate.so - it is an AI customer support platform for businesses on the web.

More specifically - we will be working on an ‚Äúalternatives list‚Äù blog.

This type of blog typically is about a list of X (some number) products/services that are alternatives to another product. 

We will call the main product the ‚Äúroot‚Äù product. The ‚Äúroot‚Äù product is not necessarily OUR product, just a competitor to our product. That way, when a user searches organically for ‚Äú[root product] alternatives‚Äù - they can find our blog post of a useful list of alternatives. 

An important part of this style of blog post is that we must show OUR product as the MAIN and BEST alternative to the root product. The blog post must be biased towards OUR product - since at the end of the day, the blog post‚Äôs objective is to convert users to our product, by showing them WHY they should get an alternative to the root product AND WHY the best alternative is OUR product. 

We will be following a simple style for the sections. The style is based on a successful ‚Äúalternatives list‚Äù blog format used by the company ClickUp. 

Their ‚Äúalternatives list‚Äù blog posts from ClickUp follow the following format (somewhat; a real blog post from ClickUp‚Äôs website has been included in this prompt):
- Intro:
    - Smooth user flow into blog post‚Ä¶ discuss WHY they would need an alternative
    - Describe the root product ‚Äúwhat is [root]?‚Äù
    - Pricing of the root product
    - Paragraph leading into the point of WHY ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound too bad, right? ‚Ä¶‚Äù
    - Why do you need a [root] alternative?
- Main sections (first product of course is ours ‚Ä¶ with biased content and encouragement) + CTA at the end of the section?
    - Alternative product‚Äôs name (as heading)
    - Screenshot of the alternative product landing page
    - Short description (regular text)
    - Features section (bullet points)
    - OPTIONAL ‚Äì [root product] vs [alternative] ‚Äìshort paragraph  + some bullets
    - Pros section (bullets)
    - Cons section (bullets)
    - Pricing (bullets)
- Concluding section: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ with [root] alternatives‚Äù
    - Root for our product
    - Why our product vs. the other alternatives
    - CTA for our product

Here is an example introduction from a ClickUp alternatives list blog post:

_Looking for the best_ _Todoist alternatives__?_

Todoist is no stranger to project management; it‚Äôs been alive and kicking since 2007!

‚Ä¶But as one of the **veteran** organizational apps, wouldn‚Äôt it be a little rusty by now?

While its to-do list feature has been updated to accommodate our modern (and frantic) work pace, its age still shows.

Overall, Todoist‚Äôs [project management software](https://clickup.com/blog/free-project-management-software/)
 features are pretty basic compared to other tools and it requires a lot of add-ons to keep up with daily processes. And since Todoist is better suited for simple to-do lists rather than managing projects, tasks, and workflows, it‚Äôs not uncommon for teams to seek out more dynamic and fresher Todoist alternatives.

Read along for a deep dive into the limitations of Todoist. Plus, a breakdown of its 15 best alternatives including pros, cons, pricing, reviews, and more!

What Is Todoist?
----------------

![todoist product example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201037%20638'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

via [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

Todoist is a [task management tool](https://clickup.com/blog/task-management-software/)
 that allows you to organize, plan, and collaborate on lists and projects. Its clean and intuitive interface makes it an attractive software option for individuals and small teams alike. Some of its best features include:

*   Assign tasks to yourself or your team
*   Recurring task due dates
*   Deadline reminders
*   Progress tracking

Plus, Todoist is relatively affordable, especially for personal use. üí∏

In addition to a free version for basic use, Todoist offers two paid plans for additional functionality:

*   **Todoist Pro**: $4 per month for individual users
*   **Todoist Business**: $6 per user, per month for teams

Doesn‚Äôt sound too bad, right? But when the going gets rough‚ÄîAKA, when you‚Äôre dealing with more complex projects‚ÄîTodoist might not cut it, and you‚Äôll be back looking for a solution with features that go beyond general task management.

Why Do You Need a Todoist Alternative?
--------------------------------------

Todoist is a _good_ task management app‚Äîbut not great_._ üëÄ

Here are a few big reasons why:

*   There‚Äôs no built-in time-tracking feature to manage your productivity while completing tasks.
*   You can‚Äôt create custom statuses to align with and manage your workflows.
*   Many features in Todoist‚Äôs paid plans are offered for free with other software.
*   It‚Äôs not as effective for work that requires more than a set of lists to complete.
*   The free version is [now limited](https://zapier.com/blog/free-todoist-account-five-project-limit/)
     to 5 active projects‚Ä¶the old limit was 80. üòê

‚Ä¶and more. üò≥

Here are the best 15 Todoist alternatives for teams of any size, budget, or industry.
```
In the above example the "root" product was "Todoist" and "OUR" product would have been ClickUp, which is shown as the first alternative. 

Here is an example of the first/main section of the blog post (right after the intro) - which shows and roots for OUR product. Following the same example blog post as above, we have:
```md
### 1\. ClickUp

```
You can see that the section is lengthy (when compared to the regular alternative sections) - and persuasive.

Here is what a regular section should look like:
```md
### 2\. Tick Tick

![TickTick product example](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201400%20660'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

via [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US)

Tick Tick has a few powerful task management abilities, which make it a quality contender as a Todoist alternative.

But if you‚Äôre looking for a tool that offers a free version with many useful features, you may have to look elsewhere.

**_Compare [TickTick Vs Todoist](https://clickup.com/blog/ticktick-vs-todoist/)
!_**

#### Features

*   Built-in [Pomodoro timer](https://clickup.com/blog/the-best-pomodoro-timer-apps/)

     for the day

*   Various calendar views
*   Available for iOS (iPhone & iPad)and Android

#### Cons

*   No native calendar sync
*   Limited integration options

#### Pricing

*   Basic Plan can be upgraded to Premium Plan at $27.99 per year

#### Customer ratings

*   **Capterra:** 4.8/5 (80+ reviews)
*   **G2:** 4.5/5 (80+ reviews)
```
You will notice it has most of the same things as the main section, but it is much shorter, and more descriptive rather than persuasive. 

And finally, here is the conclusion:

```

Your task will be to generate an entire blog post, based on all of the information a user provides you with. 

The user will provide you with information in JSON format, and you must respond in strictly markdown format. your output should be only the finalized blog post - properly formatted with markdown. You should make use of the markdown to make the blog post as readable and enjoyable for a user as possible!

Information will be provided to you in the following format:
```json
{
rootProduct: {
url: string,
screenshotPath: string,
extractedContent: string,
}
},
ourProduct: {
url: string,
screenshotPath: string,
extractedContent: string,
},
alternativeProducts: [{
url: string,
screenshotPath: string,
extractedContent: string,
}]
}
```
the `extractedContent` string will be a stringified JSON of the following format:
```
{
  "features": [{"quote": "...", "source": "..."}],
  "pricing": [{"quote": "...", "source": "..."}],
  "pros": [{"quote": "...", "source": "..."}],
  "cons": [{"quote": "...", "source": "..."}]
}
```
where "quote" is text that came directly from the source url.

Make sure that you only extract/include things in your blog post IF they were in the provided contents. You are not allowed to make up any information. This is extremely important for things like features, pricing information, ratings, etc‚Ä¶ If there are any clear mistakes - Google will interpret our blog post as unreliable and could penalize our search rankings.

Regarding your tone, style of writing - you should use the same exact style as the ClickUp blog used. A good litmus test for your style of writing is that I should be able to append your generated section to the end of the ClickUp article and not have it sound out of place (apart from the fact that the content and products are different; of course!)

Some extra notes:
* The product descriptions should closely mirror the style and structure of the ClickUp example. It should consist of 3-5 sentences, separated by spaces, and provide a comprehensive introduction to the product.
* The sections should end with the customer ratings and should not include a conclusion or summary paragraph. Please note that in our specific case, we have not provided the customer ratings, so you may exclude this section. Therefore your alternative product sections should end with the cons sub section.
* It is extremely important that you match the tone, style, and structure of the ClickUp blog as closely as possible, treating it as a template to be followed rather than just an example for reference.
* Review the ClickUp example multiple times before starting to write, to ensure a closer match in style and format.
* Aim to make the section read as if it were written by the same author as the ClickUp blog, maintaining consistency in voice and presentation.

You must return the entire blog post - not something partial.
Make sure everything is properly formatted in markdown. Do not add a ```md tag at the beginning or end. Only return the markdown contents.
