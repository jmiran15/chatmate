### An open letter from our CEO: welcome to the age of AI-first

In customer service, we all share the same goal: to provide best-in-class customer experiences.

AI represents an unprecedented new way—not just to achieve that goal—but to redefine it. Our AI-first platform is built on a single AI system with three major components designed to transform customer service for everyone.

AI Agent provides instant, accurate answers for customers 24/7. AI Copilot provides instant, always-on assistance for support agents. AI Analyst (coming in 2024) provides holistic AI insights and recommendations for support leaders.

All three learn from every customer conversation to improve the system. That’s what makes Intercom the only complete AI-first customer service platform. And we are determined to make Intercom the best, and the only customer service platform you will ever need.
