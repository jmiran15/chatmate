**Co-Founder & Social Media Expert** 

Hi, I’m Savannah
================

I've always been passionate about social media and content creation. Growing up in a family business inspired me to start my own, leading to the creation of Socialgage Media.

During my time as an advertising student at the University of Central Florida, I dove deeper into my passions and started freelancing social media management services for local businesses.

I've had the pleasure of working with diverse clients, from hairstylists to jewelry companies to a riverboat cruise company. This broad experience has equipped me with the skills to support businesses of all kinds.

I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating with you to transform your business!

1.  I picked up my first camera at the age of 12—a Nikon D40 that belonged to my parents.
    
2.  I was born and raised in Central Florida.
    
3.  In my free time, I love relaxing at the beach and binge-watching the latest Netflix series.
    
4.  I have a dog named Luna. She is a Yorkie-Chihuahua Mix.
