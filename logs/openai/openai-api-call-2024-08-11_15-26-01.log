Curious about Google Sheets?
----------------------------

Take a look at our FAQs to learn more.

*   Anyone with a Google Account can create in Sheets.
    
    However, some features such as joining a Meet call from your documents are only available on Google Workspace plans, and Gemini for Workspace features like Help me organize are available as an add-on; see plans and pricing for organizations or Google Workspace Individual. 
*   Yes. You can convert Microsoft Excel spreadsheets into Google Sheets format, or you can directly edit Excel spreadsheets, without having to make a copy. The original file will remain intact.
    
*   Co-editing means that multiple people can work on the same spreadsheet at the same time, without having to send versions back and forth. Sharing settings allows you to control who can view and edit a spreadsheet, and revision history enables you to revert to earlier versions. Also available in Google Docs and Slides.
