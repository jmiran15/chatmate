Everything IT teams need. Everything business teams want.  
**Just a prompt away.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build any workflow in minutes with AI
-------------------------------------

Build, automate, and manage every workflow with a single tool built for business teams.

Coding → Low/No-code → Typing

It doesn’t get any easier than this. AI creates workflows using natural language, prompts, and an intuitive user interface.

![Image 11](https://assets-site.staticpipefy.com/production/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bgDeploy.png)

Expedited customization

Business teams and non-technical users can quickly edit and customize workflows with an IT-approved solution that’s secure and easy-to-use.

Automate and deliver more, faster than ever
-------------------------------------------

Avoid errors, cut lead times, and reduce manual work by 40% with process automation and AI.

Automate away

AI automates repetitive manual tasks including data extraction, image recognition, emails, status updates, invoice matching, approvals, and more.

![Image 20: video cover](https://assets-site.staticpipefy.com/production/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tab4.png)

![Image 21](https://assets-site.staticpipefy.com/production/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bgAutomate.png)

Deliver exceptional service

From intake to approval, AI improves user experiences by answering common questions, centralizing documents and information, and helping users submit and track their requests.

![Image 23: Placeholder image](https://www.pipefy.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/pipefy-blocks/assets/images/general/default-placeholder.png)

Conserve resources

Automation enables business teams to make better use of their time. And when business teams build more of their own workflows – up to 85% of them – IT has more time for strategy, security, and innovation.
