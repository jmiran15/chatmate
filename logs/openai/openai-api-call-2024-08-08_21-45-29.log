### An open letter from our CEO: welcome to the age of AI-first

In customer service, we all share the same goal: to provide best-in-class customer experiences.

AI represents an unprecedented new way—not just to achieve that goal—but to redefine it. Our AI-first platform is built on a single AI system with three major components designed to transform customer service for everyone.

AI Agent provides instant, accurate answers for customers 24/7. AI Copilot provides instant, always-on assistance for support agents. AI Analyst (coming in 2024) provides holistic AI insights and recommendations for support leaders.

All three learn from every customer conversation to improve the system. That’s what makes Intercom the only complete AI-first customer service platform. And we are determined to make Intercom the best, and the only customer service platform you will ever need.

Your questions, answered
------------------------

How does Intercom pricing work?

Intercom offers three plans (Essential, Advanced, Expert), which all give you access to the Intercom platform. Access to Intercom requires a seat for the help desk. Every plan includes access to Intercom’s AI Agent and channels, both of which are subject to additional usage charges. Proactive support includes usage of banners, in-product chats, tooltips and more. You can include the Proactive Support Plus add-on in any plan from $99/month (additional charges may apply, see below).

[Learn more about Intercom pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061614-intercom-plans-explained)

Full Seats
----------

Seats provide access to Intercom’s products and features within your chosen plan. Each teammate using Intercom must have a designated seat assigned to them.

[Learn more about seat pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8205716-seats)

Lite Seats
----------

Lite seats provide limited access to Intercom to support cross-functional collaboration. A set number of Lite seats are included without additional charge on the Advanced and Expert plans. Note that Lite seats are not included on the Essential plan.

[Learn more about Lite seats](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8205716-seats#h_b37e53dd64)

What payment methods does Intercom accept?

For customers who sign up and pay online, we accept all major credit cards.  To pay via ACH or wire, please contact our sales team.

Please note: Intercom is billed in United States Dollars (USD) only.

Can I pay in my local currency?

Intercom is billed in United States Dollars (USD) only. This applies across our whole platform, including seat pricing, additional usage charges, add-ons, and Premier Services. Right now, we can’t bill in any other currencies.

Are there any additional usage charges?

In addition to Seats and ‘Proactive Support Plus’, you only pay for what you use. Here’s a breakdown:

WhatsApp:
---------

WhatsApp is charged per ‘conversation’, with unit costs varying by volume. We have different pricing for inbound and outbound WhatsApp. [Learn more about WhatsApp pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061703-usage-based-channels#h_13e2dcaf16)

SMS:
----

SMS is charged per the number of “SMS sent and/or received” with unit costs varying by volume. Prices also vary by region. [Learn more about SMS pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061703-usage-based-channels#h_ee3403f06b)

Emails and Email Campaigns:
---------------------------

Emails sent from the Inbox have no additional charge. Inbound emails from your customers and responses to those emails are included in your plan, with no additional charge. Email campaigns are charged per the number of ‘Bulk Emails Sent’, which are emails sent to more than one customer. [Learn more about Email pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061703-usage-based-channels#h_6fdc658267)

Fin Resolutions:
----------------

Fin AI Agent usage is measured in ‘resolutions.’ This ensures that you only pay when Fin achieves the outcome you and your customers care about most – resolved conversations. Resolutions are counted if Fin provides an answer (AI Answer or Custom Answer) in a conversation and the customer confirms the answer provided is satisfactory or exits the conversation without requesting further assistance. [Learn more about Fin AI Agent pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8205718-fin-resolutions-and-custom-answers)

Proactive Support Plus & Messages Sent:
---------------------------------------

Purchasing the ‘Proactive Support Plus’ add-on unlocks a number of capabilities including product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels. The baseline monthly fee includes 500 Messages Sent every month (see below for how ‘Messages Sent’ is calculated). Any messages sent above 500 per month are at an additional cost and charged per ‘Message Sent.’ [Learn more about Proactive Support Plus](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061648-proactive-support-plus)

How does the free trial work?

Intercom’s free trial requires no credit card to sign up. During the 14-day trial, you’ll have access to all the products & features available in the Advanced plan as well as Proactive Support Plus. After the free trial period, simply add your credit card details to continue using Intercom.

If you’re interested in a free trial of the Expert plan, [contact sales](https://www.intercom.com/pricing#talk_to_sales).

How can I change my plan or number of seats?

You can easily upgrade or downgrade between the Essential, Advanced or Expert plans, and add or remove the Proactive Support Plus add-on at any time.

Customers on annual plans can upgrade and manage seats at any time. Downgrades will be processed at renewal.

To add seats, simply head to ‘Settings’ > ‘Teammates’ to add or remove seats. If you have the Advanced or Expert plan, you can also swap a teammate's full Seat for a free Lite Seat. To change your plan, simply head to ‘Billing’ > ‘Subscriptions’.

[Learn more about changing or canceling your plans](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8344189-how-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-from-a-plan)

What is Fin?

Fin is the identity of Intercom’s AI tools that are integrated across the Intercom platform. Fin AI Agent provides instant, accurate answers for customers 24/7 over live chat and email. Fin AI Copilot provides instant, always-on assistance for support agents directly in the inbox.

Fin AI Agent is priced per resolution, and Fin AI Copilot is priced as a per seat add-on.

What is Fin AI Copilot?

Fin AI Copilot is an AI assistant in the inbox designed specifically for customer support agents. Fin AI Copilot helps your team instantly find answers, figure out next steps, troubleshoot issues, and answer follow-up questions. That means your agents spend less time searching for information and more time building deeper customer relationships.

How much does it cost?

Every Intercom plan includes limited usage of Fin AI Copilot. Teammates can use Fin on 10 conversations or tickets per month.

For unlimited usage (subject to the [Additional Product Terms](https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies/additional-product-terms) for AI Products) you can add unlimited Fin AI Copilot to any Full seat, and will be charged an additional $35 per seat per month.

Learn more about [seat pricing](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8205716-intercom-seats-full-seats-and-lite-seats)

How does the included usage work?

Every Intercom plan includes limited usage of Fin AI Copilot. Teammates can use Fin on 10 conversations or tickets per month. Your included usage will reset on the first day of every month.

For unlimited usage (subject to the [Additional Product Terms](https://www.intercom.com/legal/terms-and-policies/additional-product-terms) for AI Products) you can add unlimited Fin AI Copilot to any Full seat, and will be charged an additional $35 per seat per month.

Do I need to purchase Fin AI Copilot unlimited seats for my entire team?

Fin AI Copilot unlimited seats can be purchased for any teammate with a Full Seat. You can buy as many seats as you need.

What does the Proactive Support Plus add-on include?

The ‘Proactive Support Plus’ add-on is charged at a fixed monthly fee of $99. Purchasing the ‘Proactive Support Plus’ add-on unlocks a number of capabilities including product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels. This includes 500 ‘Messages Sent’ every month. Any Messages Sent above 500 per month are an additional cost and charged on the ‘Messages Sent’ metric. [Learn more about Proactive Support Plus](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061648-proactive-support-plus)

How is ‘Messages Sent’ calculated?

‘Messages Sent’ is the metric that Intercom uses to calculate charges for certain message types within the Proactive Support Plus add-on. These message types are: product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels.

‘Messages Sent’ is calculated by totaling all messages sent through product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels during a billing month.

The baseline monthly fee for ‘Proactive Support Plus’ includes 500 Messages Sent every month. Usage above this amount will be charged per unit (see additional usage question above).

For example: If you send 1000 product tours, 1000 surveys, and 2000 mobile push messages during a billing month, your ‘Messages Sent’ total for that billing month would be 4000. Since the first 500 ‘Messages Sent’ are included each billing month, they are free. Only the additional 3500 Messages Sent’ would be billed as an additional charge.

[Learn more about ‘Messages Sent’](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061648-proactive-support-plus#h_45c5377e15)

The best performing AI
----------------------

In a head-to-head study of Intercom's Fin AI Agent and Zendesk's AI bot, Fin performed better across metrics like answer rate, answer accuracy and answer quality.

Fin is able to maintain a conversational flow by asking clarifying questions and taking actions for customers across third party systems. Zendesk's bot lacks these abilities, giving a default reply when it can't answer.

This means Fin will always answer more complex questions than Zendesk. And it's why Fin wins on answer quality metrics like completeness, helpfulness, clarity, and readability.

A seamless, self-improving system
---------------------------------

Intercom's platform is powered by a single connected system. All your content and data can be managed in one place, and your AI agent can hand off to your human agents for a seamless customer experience.

And because AI and humans work together, they learn from each other. So the more issues you resolve, the smarter the system gets—and the better service you provide.

![Image 18: Intercom's self-improving AI System Model](https://images.ctfassets.net/xny2w179f4ki/3uqIxLgob5VtV7xVZfnkuM/1a197cdbafdfe408691a212dbaf53e0f/Group_17909.webp?&q=90&w=1412)

Having Intercom bring AI features to the market so quickly, and iterate on them so fast has been super valuable for us……every other day you’re like “hey, check out this new thing”

###### Angelo Livanos

Senior Director of Global Support, Lightspeed

 

The product innovation and vision Intercom shows is creating a new category in support.

###### Luke Cullimore

Senior Revenue Operations Lead, Birdie

 

We were using Zendesk but found the experience challenging and a bit dated. I wanted to create a different customer experience and Intercom was thinking about AI really early.

The only CS platform with a proactive support solution
------------------------------------------------------

Intercom is the only customer service platform with a proactive support solution, so you can get ahead of support issues before they happen.

You can onboard, educate, and notify your customers with outbound messages that include product tours, banners, tooltips, and more.

By proactively targeting specific customers, we’ve seen a reduction of almost 80% in the contact rate for temporary issues.

###### Christian Parker

We use Intercom for our self-service customers. They get product education through checklists, product tours, outbound messages, and help documentation throughout their journey.

###### Kara Gladish

Manager of Customer Experience at Webex Events

 

A key value differentiator of Intercom compared with Zendesk was its ability to offer proactive and self-serve support capabilities.

AI on all plans
---------------

#### AI for all

Our AI is for everyone, which is why our AI agent and AI copilot are available on all of our pricing plans—not gated like other platforms.

#### Priced to value

With Fin AI Agent, you only pay for the outcome you care about most—resolved conversations.

Compared to Zendesk's AI bot, Fin AI Agent performs better and is always cheaper at $0.99 per resolution. With Zendesk you can pay as much as $2 for the same outcome.

### AI for all

#### From$29per month
