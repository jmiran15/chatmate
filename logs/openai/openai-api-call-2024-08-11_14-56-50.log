[user]: You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting comprehensive and accurate product information from website content. Your primary goal is to gather all relevant details without missing any crucial information. Follow these steps meticulously:
  
  1. Carefully analyze the content from each provided website. Pay close attention to all sections, including headers, subheaders, bullet points, and any emphasized text.
  
  2. Extract relevant information for the following categories:
     - Product name (be as specific as possible, including any version numbers if applicable)
     - Tagline (the main slogan or catchphrase used to describe the product)
     - Short description (a concise overview of what the product does)
     - Unique selling proposition (what sets this product apart from competitors)
     - Primary use case (the main problem this product solves or its primary function)
     - Key features (important capabilities or aspects of the product)
     - Pros (advantages or benefits of using the product)
     - Cons (limitations, drawbacks, or potential issues with the product)
     - Pricing plans (all available pricing tiers and what they include)
     - Integrations (other tools or services this product can work with)
     - Support options (ways users can get help or assistance)
  
  3. Use verbatim quotes from the provided content. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or infer information not explicitly stated.
  
  4. Include the exact source URL for each piece of extracted information. If a piece of information appears on multiple pages, include all relevant URLs.
  
  5. Be thorough: look for information in all parts of the website content, including navigation menus, footers, and any linked pages provided.
  
  6. If you cannot find information for a category, explicitly state "No information found" for that category.
  
  7. If you find conflicting information, include all versions and note the conflict.
  
  The website content is delimited by triple backticks and prefixed with its source URL:
  
  Source URL: https://www.pipefy.com

Everything IT teams need. Everything business teams want.  
**Just a prompt away.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build any workflow in minutes with AI
-------------------------------------

Build, automate, and manage every workflow with a single tool built for business teams.

Automate and deliver more, faster than ever
-------------------------------------------

Avoid errors, cut lead times, and reduce manual work by 40% with process automation and AI.

Automate away

AI automates repetitive manual tasks including data extraction, image recognition, emails, status updates, invoice matching, approvals, and more.

![Image 21](https://assets-site.staticpipefy.com/production/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bgAutomate.png)

Deliver exceptional service

From intake to approval, AI improves user experiences by answering common questions, centralizing documents and information, and helping users submit and track their requests.

Conserve resources

Automation enables business teams to make better use of their time. And when business teams build more of their own workflows – up to 85% of them – IT has more time for strategy, security, and innovation.

If you need help, we are ready to provide guidance and support.

Do I need any advanced technical skills or professional support services to implement Pipefy?

Pipefy is designed to be simple and easy, allowing anyone to configure their own processes and workflows. However, in large and complex operations some companies like to have the support of our professional consultants – in this case we can recommend companies that offer those services.

Will my data be private and safe?

Keeping your data secure is a top priority at Pipefy. Review our security protocols and how your business and customer data will be protected in our security whitepaper.

If you need to add new members, you can do that. The amount charged per new user will be the same for the other members included in your plan. [See our article for more information](https://help.pipefy.com/en/articles/619504-pipefy-pricing-policies).

Can I change plans anytime I want? How long are the contracts?

The contracts can be monthly or yearly. You can start/stop or make changes to your plan any time you want – however, we won’t give refunds for cancellation or plan downgrades. [See our article for more information](https://help.pipefy.com/en/articles/614618-how-to-cancel-a-pipefy-subscription).

Luis Fernando Salazar Canas

Regional Manager at Infina Financial Services

We were communicating with our clients by email and manually tracking the progress of each marketing request. Nowadays, **100% of the requests that are captured on Pipefy correctly, are executed correctly.**

Devon Meerholz

Chief Creative and Operations Officer at IMImobile South Africa

Now, when hiring managers submit recruitment requests, **they have to answer a series of questions, such as salary and job requirements.** So when we get the requests, we don’t have to track down missing information.
