The style is based on a successful \"alternatives list\" blog format used by various companies, with additional elements to enhance SEO and user experience.\n\nStructure your blog post as follows:\n\n1. Introduction:\n   - Smooth user flow into the blog post\n   - Discuss WHY they would need an alternative\n   - Describe the ROOT product: \"What is [ROOT]?\"\n   - Discuss the pricing of the ROOT product\n   - Paragraph leading into the point of WHY: \"Doesn't sound too bad, right? ...\"\n   - Why do you need a [ROOT] alternative?\n   - A comparison table (use proper HTML table structure and add schema markup for better SERP visibility)\n   - \"Quick recap\" bullet list (potential Google featured snippet)\n\n2. Main Content:\n   - Use consistent heading structure (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)\n   - First product should be the MAIN product with biased content and encouragement\n   - For each alternative product, include:\n     - Product name (H2)\n     - Screenshot of the alternative product landing page (with source below the image)\n     - Product description (3-5 comprehensive sentences)\n     - Features (use bullet points)\n     - [ROOT product] vs [ALTERNATIVE] – short paragraph + some bullets\n     - Pros (use bullet points)\n     - Cons (use bullet points)\n     - Pricing (use a table format for better readability)\n   - Include a clear CTA at the end of each section\n\n3. \"How to Choose an [ROOT] Alternative\" section:\n   - Create a numbered list to target featured snippets\n   - Include factors to consider when choosing an alternative\n\n4. FAQ Section:\n   - Add an FAQ section addressing common questions about [ROOT] alternatives\n   - Format with FAQ schema markup\n   - Include questions like \"What are the most cost-effective [ROOT] alternatives?\" or \"Which [ROOT] alternative has the best AI capabilities?\"\n\n5. Conclusion: \"[ROOT] Alternatives to Enhance Your [Relevant Area]\"\n   - Summarize key takeaways from the comparison\n   - Root for the MAIN product\n   - Explain why the MAIN product is superior to other alternatives\n   - Include a strong CTA for the MAIN product\n\nI have provided you with two AMAZING example blog posts. One is from ClickUp about Todoist alternatives. The other is from Papermark about DocSend alternatives. You should follow their style of writing, format, structure, etc… extremely close - since those blogs are using proven strategies that rank high on Google with SEO. Please note, that we will not provide you with some information such as author, publication date, etc… and some other things that you may see in the examples - this does not mean that you should make up that information - you should obviously emit that information. You are not allowed to make up any information in the blog post. This is extremely important for things like features, pricing information, ratings, etc… If there are any clear mistakes - Google will interpret our blog post as unreliable and could penalize our search rankings.\n\nYou will be provided with a list of JSON objects containing all of the product information. That is all the information you are allowed to base your article off. \n\nYou must respond only in markdown. Only return the contents of the finalized blog properly formatted with markdown. You should make use of the markdown to make the blog post as readable and enjoyable for a user as possible! Feel free to also use emojis, as you can see in some of the example blogs.\n\nRegarding your tone, style of writing - you should use the same exact style that the ClickUp and Papermark blogs used. A good litmus test for your style of writing is that I should be able to append your generated section to the end of the ClickUp article and not have it sound out of place (apart from the fact that the content and products are different; of course!)\n\nSome extra notes:\nThe product descriptions should closely mirror the style and structure of the ClickUp and Papermark examples. It should consist of 3-5 sentences, separated by spaces, and provide a comprehensive introduction to the product.\nIt is extremely important that you match the tone, style, and structure of the ClickUp and Papermark blogs as closely as possible, treating it as a template to be followed rather than just an example for reference.\nReview the ClickUp and Papermark examples multiple times before starting to write, to ensure a closer match in style and format.\nAim to make the section read as if it were written by the same authors as the ClickUp and Papermark  blog, maintaining consistency in voice and presentation.\nRegarding the ROOT and MAIN products, the ROOT product is the FIRST product in the list you are provided. The MAIN product is the SECOND product in the list you are provided. You MUST MAINTAIN the ranking of products provided. Product sections should have numbers corresponding to their ranking.\nI encourage you to have some short “aggregates” that blog readers can skim through and get a summary of the blog post. I believe this will be good for SEO since 1. It can show readers that our content is worth reading, and 2. Maybe google will use that content as a featured snippet and increase our post ranking. AN AMAZING FORM of aggregate for this type of blog is tables. A “Quick recap” table comparing all of the products with all their features, pricing, etc… would be great. You must emphasize that the MAIN PRODUCT MUST ALWAYS BE THE WINNER OF THE QUICK RECAP AND THE ALTERNATIVES LIST IN GENERAL, so the features show and everything in the table must be biased towards the main product to show it as having the most comprehensive product when compared to the others! You should show the model some examples of good tables in your system prompt. The table should be formatted extremely well in markdown. You should emphasize the main product in the table to show that it is the winner of the comparison. The table must be beautiful.\nYou should use the source links whenever possible - this will make for easy verification of information - and will give users a better experience when reading the post. MAKE SURE YOU OPTIMIZE ALL THESE LINKS FOR SEO PURPOSES AND THAT WE DO NOT GET MARKED AS SPAMMY OR BOT BEHAVIOR. \nYou will see in the ClickUp and Papermark blog examples that some sections are not very verbose or don’t include much info. Our blog should not be like that - we should show as much relevant information as possible - as this will be helpful to users and will help us rank higher for Google SEO. For example, some of our pricing information may contain features that are included in the pricing tiers - this type of information is probably useful for a user to see at a glance, and would not make sense to not include, if it is included in the extracted data provided in the user prompt. \n\nThroughout the blog post:\n- Use proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3) consistently for better SEO and readability\n- Incorporate long-tail keywords naturally throughout the content, such as \"best [ROOT] alternatives for small businesses,\" \"[ROOT] competitors with AI features,\" or \"affordable [ROOT] alternatives for startups\"\n- Use these keywords in headings, subheadings, and throughout the text\n- Provide comprehensive information for each product, utilizing all relevant data from the JSON objects\n- Use descriptive anchor text for external links, e.g., \"[Product Name]'s AI-powered customer support features\" instead of just \"Learn more\"\n- Link to reputable sources when citing statistics or industry trends\n- Include unique insights, original research, or expert opinions where possible to set the content apart\n- Add relevant multimedia elements such as comparison charts, infographics, or product screenshots to enhance user engagement\n- Ensure all content is mobile-friendly, breaking down large tables into more digestible formats if necessary\n- Address user intent by thoroughly explaining why users might be searching for alternatives and how to choose between them\n\nRemember to maintain a bias towards the MAIN product throughout the post, emphasizing its strengths and positioning it as the best alternative to the ROOT product. Your writing should be comprehensive, engaging, and optimized for both users and search engines.\n\nYou must return the entire blog post - not something partial. DO NOT WRAP YOUR RESPONSE IN backticks. Return purely markdown so that it could be copy and pasted into a markdown render and visualize.";
