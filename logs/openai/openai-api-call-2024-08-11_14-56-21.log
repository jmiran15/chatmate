Got a process to track? Need to watch stuff move through stages? Basecamp’s **Card Table** is what you need. It’s our unique take on kanban. ![Image 11: How Basecamp Works](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/how-basecamp-works-d0df3dce13b89e6c05f4f39db1195710cab0c0d6d3e22f4dae55a27eb92080f8.png)

Overseeing multiple projects? You could open each one to check its status. But there’s a better way to get the big picture view — it’s called **Mission Control.**

### Leave the grind behind.  
Glide through projects instead.

It’s a struggle to juggle people, projects, clients, deadlines, and expectations — especially when you’re the [underdog](https://basecamp.com/underdogs) competing against larger companies. We’re like you, we get it. That’s [why we built Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about).

**In Basecamp, each project lives on a single page.** With everything in reach, and every piece of information tracked and organized, everyone knows where to find what they need, and say what they need to say.

Here’s what project management in Basecamp looks like:

### Not everything under the sun,  
just the stuff to get things done.

Besides unlimited projects, you’ll get [pings](https://basecamp.com/features/pings) for private conversations, [reports](https://basecamp.com/features/activity-reports) to summarize the essentials, [notification protections](https://basecamp.com/features/notification-settings) so you aren’t constantly distracted, a [timeline](https://basecamp.com/features/lineup) showing you everything that’s happening, [exceptional customer service](https://basecamp.com/support), and [plenty more](https://basecamp.com/features) to round it out.

**Basecamp also helps you consolidate billing, cut costs, and simplify onboarding.** When you use Basecamp you don’t need separate apps for chat, file sharing, tasks, or basic scheduling. No more bouncing around, losing stuff, wondering where someone put something, paying multiple bills or onboarding people in multiple places. **Less isn’t more, it’s better.**

 ![Image 31: Chat](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/chat-7f225de247735062bbc27773e3b3316dc5357a45133f6cd97afdd826a0f942b2.png)

With real-time **Chat** built into every Basecamp project, you can ditch whatever separate chat app you’re using (and save money, too). ![Image 32: Timesheet](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/timesheet-5595838a493dc64bd1f72f6d42abfee8729309953ccea6367e4178dd610419f5.png)

With the **Timesheet** add-on, you can track time directly in Basecamp — no spreadsheets required. ![Image 33: Lineup](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/lineup-46c1263f0a408b7a43553b90c41b8cd708f21e986227a643da7201f56c4c0c45.png)

Basecamp’s **Lineup** shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once, on a single timeline. So clear.

### A well-run company is part  
of the package, too.

**To-dos** are straightforward, simple, and clear. Make lists, add items, delegate, discuss, and stay in the loop as work gets done (or know when it doesn’t). ![Image 36: Doors](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/doors-dc5ac6aef6d9f78c1a2b4339578cee6dd8777f76c6fa2c85acf7b4aca4387658.png)

Use a few other products too? No problem — **Doors** let you link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s tools. ![Image 37: Schedule](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/schedule-1537889b2c251a0db8a4d7283d2c39fde62212df6c446328a9fcc2a5c503d8d9.png)

**Schedule** events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything. Pull them right into the calendar of your choice, too.

![Image 38](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/illustration/bubbles-366b434f9042d631a47c91b96e28c551bd774ba512d97c737016592fcedf6033.svg)

### The top choice of savvy teams looking for a big advantage.

Used by top notch **marketers**, ad agencies, designers, **client services firms**, consultants, **software developers**, freelancers, **PR agencies**, contractors, schools, **non-profits**, first responders, and many others. **Over 75,000 organizations, across every industry imaginable, in 166 countries, use Basecamp for project management.**

> “I’ve used Basecamp for a million projects over the last decade and a half. **It’s beautiful software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the things that mattered most.** Highly recommended.” —Tobi Lütke, CEO, Shopify

Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell, a cartoonist for The New Yorker, used to keep her client notes, doodles, ideas, and invoicing scribbled on post-its, napkins, a pile of sketchbooks, emails and texts — **then she discovered Basecamp for project management.**

 ![Image 40: Message Board](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/message-board-d7b714967ccdb96ce0695d642daa0fa30ed5292803f6db86e1ba34e7362803e6.png)

Instead of blasting emails across your organization, post messages on a centralized **Message Board** instead. Keep conversations centralized, organised, and accessible. ![Image 41: Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/hill-charts-3bd886ed7b0869f4f0b58a95dc706a9005cfec8f4850f37d1b285a3f134de534.png)

Instead of wondering what “73% done” really means, Basecamp’s **Hill Charts** give you a visual, intuitive sense of where projects really stand. ![Image 42: Docs & Files](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/docs-and-files-317fe71d1239a90930ac3e054c59b7fdf038e20dbe125e8e668ea79b98fd81b6.png)

Every project has its own **Docs & Files** library to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Even if they’re in the cloud on other services.

### Change for the better.

We asked our customers **“What changed for the better since you switched to Basecamp for project management?”** [Thousands responded](https://basecamp.com/customers), here’s some of what they said:

Timesheets

With the “Timesheet” add-on, you can track time directly in Basecamp — no spreadsheets required.

 ![Image 43: Timesheet](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/timesheet-framed-d0aa82080a6627a2cf790fd7cd8394f3d31464ccea527f065d78fb762e46cb9a.png)

View and filter timesheets across the account, and **export the results as a CSV file.**

Mission Control

Mission Control shows you which projects are on track and which ones need a helping hand.

Chat

Basecamp has chat built in so you don’t need to pay for a separate chat service like Slack.

 ![Image 45: Chat](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/chat-framed-bd808562261cf1315081b8545ebf5d7765c50aa22e4392522bb16264cea652f5.png)

Card Table

Card Tables are for tracking work that moves through stages. It’s like kanban, only better.

 ![Image 46: Card Table](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/card-table-framed-9618518ce195addd7fd0adb6fdba8571cbef5d7a5b35ee37fbb5b76c26280931.png)

Not everyone needs to know about things as they happen. **Basecamp only notifies the people who need to know**, so no one’s unnecessarily distracted.

Docs & Files

Every project includes space to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Cloud or local.

 ![Image 47: Docs & Files](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/docs-and-files-framed-00a9ea4176897b3e9fc1ddce249c07d8a59305fa0bc21f42c75a8f0b2a498546.png)

Message Board

Keep the entire conversation about a specific topic together on a single page.

 ![Image 48: Message Board](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/message-board-framed-2bb414920305bff92430b33f0d797f41eec6ea810d8311a84eb65741f915e1d0.png)

In Basecamp, **everyone sees the same version of the full conversation**. This way everyone’s always on the same page. No more forwarding emails to bring people up to speed.

Since not everyone needs to know about things as they happen. **Basecamp only notifies the people who need to know**, so no one’s unnecessarily distracted.

Schedule

Set up events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything important — ever.

 ![Image 49: Schedule](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/schedule-framed-fd697885dbecef0c806e10ca457ef89b5381274aa7d182cfa177ef05c4938366.png)

To-dos

The powerful place to track work, deadlines, responsibilities, progress, and details.

 ![Image 50: To-dos](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/to-dos-framed-e889382bf8632c88ba9dfa64266d3432161f2a0e8c75dc31cafbcad64109cbaf.png)

Instantly understandable, impossibly powerful, Basecamp’s to-do lists do much of the heavy lifting for you.

Make as many lists as you want, assign as many people as you need, be notified when things are late or complete. It’s the full package in the simplest form.

We invented “Hill Charts” to give you a visual, intuitive sense of where projects really stand.

 ![Image 51: Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/hill-charts-1d43238ad79fd90fe0e868aefc7a695f812544273d4f592c6bc81206446230ea.png)

Progress is more like a hill than a straight line. Basecamp-exclusive **Hill Charts provide a unique look into what remains** to figure out (uphill), and what’s in production (downhill). [Hmm, tell me more](https://basecamp.com/hill-charts).

Invented here, and only available in Basecamp, Hill Charts are game changers. Once you use them you’ll never want to work without them again.

“The Lineup” shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once.

 ![Image 52: Lineup](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/lineup-framed-6a6306f99130a7e4910c453f2dad0ac1e1946a63893ebcf79fde882ac4236273.png)

**Today’s always the line right down the middle**, and each project has a start and end date on either end. This way you can _see_ how much time remains on each one, relative to today, in a single glance.

Add a “Door” and link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s built-in tools.

 ![Image 53: Doors](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/doors-framed-714b618bc7551a8c9f19fba132393f1c6cca1e06901125abaeea900893082d72.png)
