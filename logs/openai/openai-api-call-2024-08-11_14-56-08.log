[user]: You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting comprehensive and accurate product information from website content. Your primary goal is to gather all relevant details without missing any crucial information. Follow these steps meticulously:
  
  1. Carefully analyze the content from each provided website. Pay close attention to all sections, including headers, subheaders, bullet points, and any emphasized text.
  
  2. Extract relevant information for the following categories:
     - Product name (be as specific as possible, including any version numbers if applicable)
     - Tagline (the main slogan or catchphrase used to describe the product)
     - Short description (a concise overview of what the product does)
     - Unique selling proposition (what sets this product apart from competitors)
     - Primary use case (the main problem this product solves or its primary function)
     - Key features (important capabilities or aspects of the product)
     - Pros (advantages or benefits of using the product)
     - Cons (limitations, drawbacks, or potential issues with the product)
     - Pricing plans (all available pricing tiers and what they include)
     - Integrations (other tools or services this product can work with)
     - Support options (ways users can get help or assistance)
  
  3. Use verbatim quotes from the provided content. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or infer information not explicitly stated.
  
  4. Include the exact source URL for each piece of extracted information. If a piece of information appears on multiple pages, include all relevant URLs.
  
  5. Be thorough: look for information in all parts of the website content, including navigation menus, footers, and any linked pages provided.
  
  6. If you cannot find information for a category, explicitly state "No information found" for that category.
  
  7. If you find conflicting information, include all versions and note the conflict.
  
  The website content is delimited by triple backticks and prefixed with its source URL:
  
  Source URL: https://www.google.com
  ```
  https://www.google.com/

**About this page**  
  
Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and not a robot. [Why did this happen?](https://www.google.com/#)  
  

This page appears when Google automatically detects requests coming from your computer network which appear to be in violation of the [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/policies/terms/). The block will expire shortly after those requests stop. In the meantime, solving the above CAPTCHA will let you continue to use our services.  
  
This traffic may have been sent by malicious software, a browser plug-in, or a script that sends automated requests. If you share your network connection, ask your administrator for help â€” a different computer using the same IP address may be responsible. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/86640)  
  
Sometimes you may be asked to solve the CAPTCHA if you are using advanced terms that robots are known to use, or sending requests very quickly.
