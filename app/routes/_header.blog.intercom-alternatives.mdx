## What Should You Look for in Intercom Alternatives?

When looking for Intercom alternatives, consider several key factors. They will help you choose the right platform for your business. Here are some of the most important things to look for:

- \***\*Features\*\***: Look for features that suit your business needs. Consider whether you need a live chat widget, chatbots, email support, or a knowledge base. Some platforms offer advanced features. These include [social media integration](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-customer-service/), reporting, analytics, and workflow automation. Here are [5 key customer service software features](https://www.capterra.com/resources/key-customer-service-software-features/) according to Capterra

- \***\*Pricing\*\***: Compare the pricing plans of different platforms. Some offer free plans or trials, while others charge per user or per feature. Consider your budget and the number of users you need to support. Look for options that offer a basic plan with essential features for small businesses. A lot of Intercom alternatives, and customer support platforms use different _pricing strategies_ which can be confusing at times. If you would like to learn more about some of the different strategies, such as flat rates, usage based, and more - I would highly recommend checking out [The ultimate guide to SaaS pricing models](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/saas-pricing-models).
- \***\*Ease of use\*\***: Look for a platform that is easy to use and set up. Examine the interface's usability, documentation quality, and customer support's promptness. A user-friendly chat solution can significantly improve your team's efficiency.
- Integrations: Check if the platform works with your other tools, like CRMs, project management software, or e-commerce platforms. Look for integrations that can help streamline your workflows and improve efficiency.
- \***\*Scalability\*\***: Consider whether the platform can scale with your business as it grows. Look for features like customizable workflows and flexible pricing. Also, check if you can add users or channels as needed.
- \***\*Security\*\***: Look for a platform that takes security seriously. Consider whether it offers features like data encryption, two-factor authentication, and compliance with industry standards like [GDPR or HIPAA](https://www.onetrust.com/blog/hipaa-vs-gdpr-compliance/).

By considering these factors, you can find an Intercom alternative that meets your business needs and helps you provide excellent customer support, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction.
