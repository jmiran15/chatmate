Fin Resolutions:
----------------

Fin AI Agent usage is measured in ‘resolutions.’ This ensures that you only pay when Fin achieves the outcome you and your customers care about most – resolved conversations. Resolutions are counted if Fin provides an answer (AI Answer or Custom Answer) in a conversation and the customer confirms the answer provided is satisfactory or exits the conversation without requesting further assistance.

Purchasing the ‘Proactive Support Plus’ add-on unlocks a number of capabilities including product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels. The baseline monthly fee includes 500 Messages Sent every month (see below for how ‘Messages Sent’ is calculated).

What does the Proactive Support Plus add-on include?

The ‘Proactive Support Plus’ add-on is charged at a fixed monthly fee of $99. Purchasing the ‘Proactive Support Plus’ add-on unlocks a number of capabilities including product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels. This includes 500 ‘Messages Sent’ every month. Any Messages Sent above 500 per month are an additional cost and charged on the ‘Messages Sent’ metric. [Learn more about Proactive Support Plus](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9061648-proactive-support-plus)

How is ‘Messages Sent’ calculated?

‘Messages Sent’ is the metric that Intercom uses to calculate charges for certain message types within the Proactive Support Plus add-on. These message types are: product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels.

‘Messages Sent’ is calculated by totaling all messages sent through product tours, surveys, in-app posts, mobile push, and mobile carousels during a billing month.

The baseline monthly fee for ‘Proactive Support Plus’ includes 500 Messages Sent every month. Usage above this amount will be charged per unit (see additional usage question above).

For example: If you send 1000 product tours, 1000 surveys, and 2000 mobile push messages during a billing month, your ‘Messages Sent’ total for that billing month would be 4000. Since the first 500 ‘Messages Sent’ are included each billing month, they are free. Only the additional 3500 Messages Sent’ would be billed as an additional charge.
