Having Intercom bring AI features to the market so quickly, and iterate on them so fast has been super valuable for us……every other day you’re like “hey, check out this new thing”

###### Angelo Livanos

Senior Director of Global Support, Lightspeed

 

The product innovation and vision Intercom shows is creating a new category in support.

###### Luke Cullimore

Senior Revenue Operations Lead, Birdie

 

We were using Zendesk but found the experience challenging and a bit dated. I wanted to create a different customer experience and Intercom was thinking about AI really early.

The only CS platform with a proactive support solution
------------------------------------------------------

Intercom is the only customer service platform with a proactive support solution, so you can get ahead of support issues before they happen.

You can onboard, educate, and notify your customers with outbound messages that include product tours, banners, tooltips, and more.

By proactively targeting specific customers, we’ve seen a reduction of almost 80% in the contact rate for temporary issues.

###### Christian Parker

Director of Managed Services at TrueCommerce

 

We use Intercom for our self-service customers. They get product education through checklists, product tours, outbound messages, and help documentation throughout their journey.

###### Kara Gladish

Manager of Customer Experience at Webex Events

 

A key value differentiator of Intercom compared with Zendesk was its ability to offer proactive and self-serve support capabilities.

AI on all plans
---------------

#### AI for all

Our AI is for everyone, which is why our AI agent and AI copilot are available on all of our pricing plans—not gated like other platforms.

#### Priced to value

With Fin AI Agent, you only pay for the outcome you care about most—resolved conversations.

Compared to Zendesk's AI bot, Fin AI Agent performs better and is always cheaper at $0.99 per resolution. With Zendesk you can pay as much as $2 for the same outcome.

### AI for all
