[user]: You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting comprehensive and accurate product information from website content. Your primary goal is to gather all relevant details without missing any crucial information. Follow these steps meticulously:
  
  1. Carefully analyze the content from each provided website. Pay close attention to all sections, including headers, subheaders, bullet points, and any emphasized text.
  
  2. Extract relevant information for the following categories:
     - Product name (be as specific as possible, including any version numbers if applicable)
     - Tagline (the main slogan or catchphrase used to describe the product)
     - Short description (a concise overview of what the product does)
     - Unique selling proposition (what sets this product apart from competitors)
     - Primary use case (the main problem this product solves or its primary function)
     - Key features (important capabilities or aspects of the product)
     - Pros (advantages or benefits of using the product)
     - Cons (limitations, drawbacks, or potential issues with the product)
     - Pricing plans (all available pricing tiers and what they include)
     - Integrations (other tools or services this product can work with)
     - Support options (ways users can get help or assistance)
  
  3. Use verbatim quotes from the provided content. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or infer information not explicitly stated.
  
  4. Include the exact source URL for each piece of extracted information. If a piece of information appears on multiple pages, include all relevant URLs.
  
  5. Be thorough: look for information in all parts of the website content, including navigation menus, footers, and any linked pages provided.
  
  6. If you cannot find information for a category, explicitly state "No information found" for that category.
  
  7. If you find conflicting information, include all versions and note the conflict.
  
  The website content is delimited by triple backticks and prefixed with its source URL:

Got a process to track? Need to watch stuff move through stages? Basecamp’s **Card Table** is what you need. It’s our unique take on kanban. ![Image 11: How Basecamp Works](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/how-basecamp-works-d0df3dce13b89e6c05f4f39db1195710cab0c0d6d3e22f4dae55a27eb92080f8.png)

Overseeing multiple projects? You could open each one to check its status. But there’s a better way to get the big picture view — it’s called **Mission Control.**

### Leave the grind behind.  
Glide through projects instead.

It’s a struggle to juggle people, projects, clients, deadlines, and expectations — especially when you’re the [underdog](https://basecamp.com/underdogs) competing against larger companies. We’re like you, we get it. That’s [why we built Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about).

**In Basecamp, each project lives on a single page.** With everything in reach, and every piece of information tracked and organized, everyone knows where to find what they need, and say what they need to say.

Here’s what project management in Basecamp looks like:

### Not everything under the sun,  
just the stuff to get things done.

Besides unlimited projects, you’ll get [pings](https://basecamp.com/features/pings) for private conversations, [reports](https://basecamp.com/features/activity-reports) to summarize the essentials, [notification protections](https://basecamp.com/features/notification-settings) so you aren’t constantly distracted, a [timeline](https://basecamp.com/features/lineup) showing you everything that’s happening, [exceptional customer service](https://basecamp.com/support), and [plenty more](https://basecamp.com/features) to round it out.

**Basecamp also helps you consolidate billing, cut costs, and simplify onboarding.** When you use Basecamp you don’t need separate apps for chat, file sharing, tasks, or basic scheduling. No more bouncing around, losing stuff, wondering where someone put something, paying multiple bills or onboarding people in multiple places. **Less isn’t more, it’s better.**

 ![Image 31: Chat](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/chat-7f225de247735062bbc27773e3b3316dc5357a45133f6cd97afdd826a0f942b2.png)

With real-time **Chat** built into every Basecamp project, you can ditch whatever separate chat app you’re using (and save money, too). ![Image 32: Timesheet](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/timesheet-5595838a493dc64bd1f72f6d42abfee8729309953ccea6367e4178dd610419f5.png)

With the **Timesheet** add-on, you can track time directly in Basecamp — no spreadsheets required. ![Image 33: Lineup](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/lineup-46c1263f0a408b7a43553b90c41b8cd708f21e986227a643da7201f56c4c0c45.png)

Basecamp’s **Lineup** shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once, on a single timeline. So clear.

### A well-run company is part  
of the package, too.

**To-dos** are straightforward, simple, and clear. Make lists, add items, delegate, discuss, and stay in the loop as work gets done (or know when it doesn’t). ![Image 36: Doors](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/doors-dc5ac6aef6d9f78c1a2b4339578cee6dd8777f76c6fa2c85acf7b4aca4387658.png)

Use a few other products too? No problem — **Doors** let you link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s tools. ![Image 37: Schedule](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/schedule-1537889b2c251a0db8a4d7283d2c39fde62212df6c446328a9fcc2a5c503d8d9.png)

**Schedule** events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything. Pull them right into the calendar of your choice, too.

### The top choice of savvy teams looking for a big advantage.

Used by top notch **marketers**, ad agencies, designers, **client services firms**, consultants, **software developers**, freelancers, **PR agencies**, contractors, schools, **non-profits**, first responders, and many others. **Over 75,000 organizations, across every industry imaginable, in 166 countries, use Basecamp for project management.**

> “I’ve used Basecamp for a million projects over the last decade and a half. **It’s beautiful software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the things that mattered most.** Highly recommended.” —Tobi Lütke, CEO, Shopify

 ![Image 39: Watch “Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell”](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/hilary-fitzgerald-campbell-85fde1fc2614ced5db697c9cab97ee82819bc87b271238fd59e400c52d907dec.png)

Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell, a cartoonist for The New Yorker, used to keep her client notes, doodles, ideas, and invoicing scribbled on post-its, napkins, a pile of sketchbooks, emails and texts — **then she discovered Basecamp for project management.**

 ![Image 40: Message Board](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/message-board-d7b714967ccdb96ce0695d642daa0fa30ed5292803f6db86e1ba34e7362803e6.png)

Instead of blasting emails across your organization, post messages on a centralized **Message Board** instead. Keep conversations centralized, organised, and accessible. ![Image 41: Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/hill-charts-3bd886ed7b0869f4f0b58a95dc706a9005cfec8f4850f37d1b285a3f134de534.png)

Instead of wondering what “73% done” really means, Basecamp’s **Hill Charts** give you a visual, intuitive sense of where projects really stand. ![Image 42: Docs & Files](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/docs-and-files-317fe71d1239a90930ac3e054c59b7fdf038e20dbe125e8e668ea79b98fd81b6.png)

Every project has its own **Docs & Files** library to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Even if they’re in the cloud on other services.

### Change for the better.

We asked our customers **“What changed for the better since you switched to Basecamp for project management?”** [Thousands responded](https://basecamp.com/customers), here’s some of what they said:

> LATE Nation & Gareth Emery

> “Before Basecamp, I ran my freelance web development business basically from a spreadsheet, then I moved to Basecamp and my life is so much less stressful. Basecamp has increased my happiness exponentially.”Patrick Krebs,  
> Sad Robot Software

> “I feel like I am better organized and more efficient because of Basecamp. It has also greatly increased our ability to collaborate on projects large or small and have a better idea of the project and all of its pieces, rather than just what I am responsible for.”Alex Jackson,  
> Luther College

> “I no longer have to wonder whether I’ve asked for something to be done or whether it has in fact been done. Every member of my team is more accountable than we were before Basecamp.”John Drover,

Timesheets

With the “Timesheet” add-on, you can track time directly in Basecamp — no spreadsheets required.

 ![Image 43: Timesheet](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/timesheet-framed-d0aa82080a6627a2cf790fd7cd8394f3d31464ccea527f065d78fb762e46cb9a.png)

View and filter timesheets across the account, and **export the results as a CSV file.**

Mission Control

Mission Control shows you which projects are on track and which ones need a helping hand.

 ![Image 44: Mission Control](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/mission-control-6fa68c1548ce67a89f5a7a0c85e8d27e9ceff6a6f7cdbdac494941a06f63f0da.png)

Chat

Basecamp has chat built in so you don’t need to pay for a separate chat service like Slack.

 ![Image 45: Chat](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/chat-framed-bd808562261cf1315081b8545ebf5d7765c50aa22e4392522bb16264cea652f5.png)

Card Table

Card Tables are for tracking work that moves through stages. It’s like kanban, only better.

 ![Image 46: Card Table](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/card-table-framed-9618518ce195addd7fd0adb6fdba8571cbef5d7a5b35ee37fbb5b76c26280931.png)

Not everyone needs to know about things as they happen. **Basecamp only notifies the people who need to know**, so no one’s unnecessarily distracted.

Docs & Files

Every project includes space to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Cloud or local.

 ![Image 47: Docs & Files](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/docs-and-files-framed-00a9ea4176897b3e9fc1ddce249c07d8a59305fa0bc21f42c75a8f0b2a498546.png)

Message Board

Keep the entire conversation about a specific topic together on a single page.

 ![Image 48: Message Board](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/message-board-framed-2bb414920305bff92430b33f0d797f41eec6ea810d8311a84eb65741f915e1d0.png)

In Basecamp, **everyone sees the same version of the full conversation**. This way everyone’s always on the same page. No more forwarding emails to bring people up to speed.

Since not everyone needs to know about things as they happen. **Basecamp only notifies the people who need to know**, so no one’s unnecessarily distracted.

Schedule

Set up events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything important — ever.

 ![Image 49: Schedule](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/schedule-framed-fd697885dbecef0c806e10ca457ef89b5381274aa7d182cfa177ef05c4938366.png)

To-dos

The powerful place to track work, deadlines, responsibilities, progress, and details.

 ![Image 50: To-dos](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/to-dos-framed-e889382bf8632c88ba9dfa64266d3432161f2a0e8c75dc31cafbcad64109cbaf.png)

Instantly understandable, impossibly powerful, Basecamp’s to-do lists do much of the heavy lifting for you.

Make as many lists as you want, assign as many people as you need, be notified when things are late or complete. It’s the full package in the simplest form.

We invented “Hill Charts” to give you a visual, intuitive sense of where projects really stand.

 ![Image 51: Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/hill-charts-1d43238ad79fd90fe0e868aefc7a695f812544273d4f592c6bc81206446230ea.png)

Progress is more like a hill than a straight line. Basecamp-exclusive **Hill Charts provide a unique look into what remains** to figure out (uphill), and what’s in production (downhill). [Hmm, tell me more](https://basecamp.com/hill-charts).

Invented here, and only available in Basecamp, Hill Charts are game changers. Once you use them you’ll never want to work without them again.

“The Lineup” shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once.

 ![Image 52: Lineup](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/lineup-framed-6a6306f99130a7e4910c453f2dad0ac1e1946a63893ebcf79fde882ac4236273.png)

**Today’s always the line right down the middle**, and each project has a start and end date on either end. This way you can _see_ how much time remains on each one, relative to today, in a single glance.

Add a “Door” and link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s built-in tools.

 ![Image 53: Doors](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/doors-framed-714b618bc7551a8c9f19fba132393f1c6cca1e06901125abaeea900893082d72.png)

Where we came from.
===================

Born out of desperate necessity to stop embarrassing ourselves in front of our clients, the story of how Basecamp was born is likely your story, too.

Hey there—

I’m Jason Fried, one of the co-founders here. I’ve been running 37signals — the business that makes Basecamp — for 23 years.

People often ask me why we built Basecamp. They’ve never seen anything like it before, so they’re curious where the idea came from.

I wish I could credit a spark of genius, or some deep insight. But I can’t. Truth is, we built Basecamp out of _desperate necessity_. We needed it bad. Without it, we were embarrassing ourselves.

Way back when, we used to be a design firm. As we grew, we kept taking on more and more projects. We thought we could handle it, while still providing the same level of service, but we couldn’t. We were fooling ourselves. Sound familiar?

It wasn’t that we didn’t have the skills — we just didn’t have the right tools, nor the method, to juggle the additional workload. We were disorganized, we were dropping balls, and stuff was slipping.

Quality was suffering, and, as is often the case in situations like this, our clients noticed before we noticed. That was the especially painful and uncomfortable part.

We needed a better way to manage projects, track feedback, and make progress. Email, chat, spreadsheets, calls, scattered documents, information here, there, and everywhere just wasn’t cutting it. Systems like that work for a minute, and then they fall apart fast — especially as you grow and add more people to the mix.

We looked around and tried a few things, but the popular tools we tried simply didn’t cut it. So we had to build our own project management system from scratch.

We focused on building a simple, straightforward collection of tools that could track work so everyone knew who was doing what, keep feedback and revisions on the record, centralize communication so no one missed anything, and schedule important milestones.

We started using the system with our clients. They kept asking “What is this? We could totally use this for our own projects!” And that’s when the lightbulb went on — maybe this is a product for others, and not just for us? If we need it, surely others need it.

So we tweaked it, tightened it up, polished the rough edges, and put it on the market. It was an instant hit.

Turns out, tens of thousands of other companies had similar struggles managing their projects, and needed what we needed.

And about a year or so after we first released it, it was generating more revenue for us than our web design business. So we stopped doing web design and have been focused on building Basecamp ever since.

Based on feedback, and our own ideas, we’ve made thousands of improvements over the years, with so much more to come. Basecamp defined a category, and continues to constantly push that category forward in innovative ways.

It’s been an incredible ride so far, and we have so many people to thank. But most of all, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to continue to make the best product we can for companies who desperately seek a better way to work. We’re here for them, 23 years and running.

Thanks for reading, and for [giving Basecamp a try](https://basecamp.com/pricing). You can always contact me directly if you have any questions at [jason@basecamp.com](mailto:jason@basecamp.com). I look forward to hearing from you.
