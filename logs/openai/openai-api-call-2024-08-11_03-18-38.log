[user]: You are an AI assistant tasked with combining and refining extracted product information. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, non-redundant, and accurate compilation of product details. Follow these steps meticulously:
  
  1. Carefully analyze the two sets of extracted product information provided below.
  2. Combine the information from both sets, ensuring no unique details are lost in the process.
  3. Remove exact duplicates, but retain information that is similar but provides additional context or detail.
  4. If there are conflicting pieces of information:
     a. Include both pieces of information.
     b. Add a note highlighting the conflict.
     c. If one source seems more authoritative (e.g., from the product's official features page rather than a blog post), prioritize it but still include the other.
  5. Ensure that all sources are preserved and accurately linked to their respective pieces of information. If a piece of information appears in both sets, include both sources.
  6. Maintain the structure of the input data in your output.
  7. For each category, order the information from most to least important or comprehensive.
  
  The two sets of extracted information are delimited by triple backticks:
