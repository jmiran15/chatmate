Your questions, answered
------------------------

How does Intercom pricing work?

Intercom offers three plans (Essential, Advanced, Expert), which all give you access to the Intercom platform. Access to Intercom requires a seat for the help desk. Every plan includes access to Intercom’s AI Agent and channels, both of which are subject to additional usage charges. Proactive support includes usage of banners, in-product chats, tooltips and more. You can include the Proactive Support Plus add-on in any plan from $99/month (additional charges may apply, see below).
