**The Solution**  
Service Hub enabled a more organized support system, resulting in fast customer response times and streamlined efficiency, without sacrificing quality service.

As Stella expanded, its founders realized they had outgrown their software setup.

**The Solution**  
Service Hub’s help desk software allows Stella’s team to prioritize tasks and organize every customer inquiry in a single, universally accessible dashboard, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.

“Our customer service reps can see all the information about the customer … We've been able to build stronger relationships with our customers,” - Aarne Töllinen, CCO and CMO, Stella

### HungryHungry Cuts Customer Onboarding Time in Half With Apps From HubSpot's App Marketplace

**The Challenge**  
HungryHungry customers were struggling to activate, and the onboarding process took too long. The business needed to engage customers earlier and improve speed to value for new customers.

**The Solution**  
Since HungryHungry implemented customer service apps from HubSpot's App Marketplace, their average customer completes onboarding twice as fast and nearly all customers are ‌onboarded successfully, getting rid of early churn.

“Anywhere you can simplify, you should. HubSpot brings together every customer interaction, from sales and marketing to onboarding and customer care. Having that single view, all in one place really helps.” -  Scott Fox, Head of Operations, HungryHungry

### Swapfiets Uses Service Hub to Drastically Shorten Ticket Response Time 

**The Challenge**  
The global Swapfiets team struggled to manage their large-scale support team that handled more than 40,000 tickets per month. They didn’t have a single source of truth for data and some tickets stayed unaddressed for months.

**The Solution**  
With HubSpot, Swapfiets ​​optimized the customer service experience. They began resolving more tickets faster to build member trust and proactively handling customer issues to improve customer retention and satisfaction.

“Service Hub is helping to provide our staff with the right tools to be more proactive and efficient so that our members can enjoy worry-free biking.” - Marc De Vries, CEO, Swapfiets

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### What is customer service software?

Customer service software is the consolidation point for managing the customer journey. It allows you to manage the onboarding of new customers; collect, organize, and respond to customer support requests; and ensure the growth and satisfaction of your customers.

While most customer service software solutions solve for a specific use case, Service Hub is unique in that it's part of the HubSpot customer platform. With features that make it easy to deliver authentic, personalized service, Service Hub empowers you to prioritize the customer experience.

### Can I implement HubSpot’s software without dedicated programmers/developers?

Yes. With automation and contextual guidance built right in, you can get started with Service Hub without involving developers. And if you’re looking for more customization and expertise, our [solutions partners](https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/solutions?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com/products/service&hubs_content-cta=service-faq-partners1) offer a wide range of specialized support to help you get the most out of your HubSpot implementation.

### Will HubSpot help me and my team get started with the software?

Of course! We’ll help all Starter, Professional, and Enterprise users get up and running quickly with a personalized onboarding plan, and our implementation specialists are available to provide guidance on technical setup.

Your whole team of free or paid users will also have access to our active community forums, training lessons from HubSpot Academy, and a comprehensive knowledge base of user guides and help documents. For especially complex configurations, businesses also leverage HubSpot’s [expansive ecosystem of over 6,000 partners](https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/solutions?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com/products/service&hubs_content-cta=service-faq-partners2) for additional support.

### What makes HubSpot’s customer service software popular?

While Service Hub stands out for the power and ease of use of its support and help desk features, it's also popular for the way it helps you put the customer first. With channels to meet customers where they are and when they need it, Service Hub lets you have contextualized and personalized interactions with customers at any point in the customer journey.

Plus, Service Hub includes HubSpot’s CRM functionality and seamlessly integrates with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Content Hub, and Operations Hub, so your entire front office team can unite around a complete view of the customer.

Last but not least, you can easily sync Service Hub with more than 1,600 custom integrations — from Jira to SurveyMonkey to Facebook Messenger — so your services team has all its favorite tools on one powerful, easy-to-use platform.

### My company already uses a CRM system. Can we integrate it with Service Hub?

Absolutely. HubSpot offers a fully supported, native Salesforce integration that’s easy to set up and use — and available to Service Hub Professional and Enterprise customers. We also offer integrations to many other CRM systems through the [HubSpot App Marketplace](https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com/products/service&hubs_content-cta=service-faq-integrations).

### How does Service Hub work with Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Content Hub, and Operations Hub?

Service Hub, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Content Hub, and Operations Hub are each part of HubSpot’s customer platform to help you grow better. When you use two or more hubs together, your data is automatically connected on the platform, enabling you to easily (and powerfully) track your entire customer journey from first website visit to closed deal to loyal customer.

### My business already uses Marketing Hub and/or Sales Hub, and I’d love to get my customer service team using Service Hub. What’s the pitch?

Sales and marketing are how we begin our customer relationships — but not necessarily where they grow. Through customer service, savvy teams can turn help issues into opportunities, and grow beyond resolution to relationship.

Service Hub helps you identify opportunities to deepen customer relationships, connect to the front office, and drive efficiency so customers have a superior experience throughout their journey.

And when all your front office teams’ tools and data are united on the same platform, your customer service team will have the full context of each customer's previous interactions with Marketing and Sales, making it easier to connect with customers in a much more personalized and powerful way.

### How much time does it take to implement customer service software?

You can get started with Service Hub in minutes, not months. The in-app onboarding process has automation and contextual guidance built right in. With our Starter, Professional, and Enterprise editions, you can partner with an [onboarding specialist](https://www.hubspot.com/services/onboarding/service-hub?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com/products/service&hubs_content-cta=service-faq-onboarding) to guide you through the journey.
