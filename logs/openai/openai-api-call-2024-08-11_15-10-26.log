FAQs

Have a question? We've got answers.
-----------------------------------

What are some tools and features that set ClickUp apart?

ClickUp’s flexible [Hierarchy](https://clickup.com/hierarchy-guide) and customization set it apart from other project management solutions. ClickUp also features [native time tracking](https://clickup.com/features/project-time-tracking) and numerous [time tracking integrations](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us), as well as [two-way email synchronization](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6303747270807-Use-Email-in-ClickUp) and a variety of [unique views](https://clickup.com/features/views) for your work.

How do I choose the right project management tool for my organization?

While there are many considerations when choosing the right software, two requirements are 1) that you and your team are willing and able to learn how to implement and use it, and 2) that it includes the features and integrations you need to organize and execute work.

How do I set up a project management tool for different projects?

While experimentation and trial and error are great ways to build and improve workflows, many users prefer to start with templates that can then be customized for their specific needs. ClickUp provides 100s of free [template](https://clickup.com/templates)s for virtually every experience level and use case.

What level of security can I expect from project management tools?

Because you will likely need to store proprietary information on any solution you choose, it should meet the minimum security requirements as stipulated by your IT or operations teams. ClickUp is SOC 2 certified and ensures end-to-end security. Read more on our [Security](https://clickup.com/terms/security-policy) page.

[View all](javascript:void\(0\))

Can I use project management tools to store personal and protected information?

Many project management platforms feature advanced security features on their higher-tier plans. For example, ClickUp’s [Enterprise Plan](https://clickup.com/plans/enterprise) includes HIPAA compliance, SSO, and other advanced security considerations.

How can I try a project management tool before deciding what plan I need?

Many platforms offer free trial periods that allow you to test out a product’s features and interface before deciding whether you want to pay for it. ClickUp goes one step further by offering a [Free Forever Plan](https://clickup.com/pricing), which allows permanent access to ClickUp at no cost.

How much should I expect to pay for a project management tool?

The answer depends on a number of factors, including team size, features required, security requirements, and more. Most project management tools cost from $5 per user per month for basic plans, up to $30+ per user per month for highly specialized enterprise-level solutions. Learn about ClickUp’s pricing [here](https://clickup.com/pricing).

What steps should I take when switching project management tools?

Before [canceling](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6303314345623-How-do-I-change-my-ClickUp-Plan-) your current subscription, ensure you know what tool you want to switch to (if any). Then, make sure that the new solution meets the needs of your organization and that you can [import your work](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6311099045783-Importing-Into-ClickUp) from your current tool to the new project management tool.

Can I import and export work from one project management tool to another?

In most cases, yes. However, before signing up for a particular platform, make sure it has the import and export capabilities you’ll need. Learn about ClickUp data portability [here](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6310786693015-Data-Portability-Export-your-Workspace-s-Data), and find out how to import work from other tools into ClickUp [here](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6311099045783-Importing-Into-ClickUp).

MISSION

Our mission.
------------

While we absolutely love productivity software, we believe productivity, in general, is broken. There's just too many tools to keep track of, too many things in entirely separate ecosystems. There has to be a better way to work - that's why we created ClickUp, first an internal tool, now as a way to fulfill our vision of making the world more productive.

Eventually, our goal is to have all work live in ClickUp - thereby making people more productive and giving back at least 20% of time to dedicate to other things. One app to replace them all. We're just getting started, and are so grateful for all of the 2 million teams that are in this together with our team.
