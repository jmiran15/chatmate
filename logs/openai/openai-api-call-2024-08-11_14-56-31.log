### Frequently asked questions

##### Can you create custom fields in Asana?

All paid Asana plans include unlimited custom fields. Additionally, Asana Basic users have access to predefined custom fields, like priority status.

Custom fields let you add additional data to tasks in your Asana projects. Creating a custom field using one of our 17 different custom field types means you can create a field for stage, priority, cost, or anything else that’s important to your workflow, team, and company.

##### Can you create a project in Asana by importing a CSV?

Yes, every CSV you import will become a project. Once imported, you’ll see your data in Asana as tasks in a project. In addition to task names and descriptions, the CSV importer supports information such as assignee, due dates, start dates, dependencies, followers, and custom fields. For more information on how to format your .csv file before importing, check out our [guide article](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/csv-importer).

##### Can you use Asana to track your personal life?

Yes, you can create an Asana project for anything. Asana customers have created projects to manage their grocery lists, their [personal to-dos](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/csv-importer), and even their weddings! Asana is flexible enough to adapt to any time management and organizational strategy you use. With My Tasks, you can view all of the work assigned to you in one place, and action on it accordingly. Whether you want to assign work to sprints and work within the [Scrum methodology](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-scrum), or timebox your work with the [Pomodoro method](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-scrum), Asana can help.

##### Can you create repeating tasks for your recurring to-dos?

Yes, you can turn any one-off to-do into a recurring task. With our date picker, it’s easy to create tasks that recur on a specific day, periodically, or within a custom time frame.

##### Can you color-code tasks?

The best way to color-code tasks is to use custom fields. Choose from our 16 color options for your single- and multi-select custom fields. Then, easily identify tasks at-a-glance based on the custom field color.
