‚Äú**I literally don't know how I survived before I ran my life on @todoist**. Not an exaggeration to say that it has revolutionised how I stay on top of multiple threads at work.‚Äù

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

‚ÄúThe ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, **the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down**. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.‚Äù

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

‚ÄúI absolutely love this app. I have ADHD, am a chronic procrastinator, and have always struggled with organizing my schoolwork. A calendar was too hard to keep track of, but **this allows me to see everything that is due right in front of me and the order in which I should do them**. Love it‚Äù

‚Äú\[I use it for\] both \[work and personal\]. **To me the best thing is that it has a simple and consistent interface** (iOS, macOS, web). I really only use organizing tasks (projects, subtasks, different views ...), reminders and recurring reminders. Other features don't get in your way.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve introduced dozens of people to Todoist, **easy learning curve with the inbox and integrations, and easy to go pro with custom filters and nesting**. I look like a superstar at work remembering all my deliverables, but Todoist is my secret sauce.‚Äù

Intuitively organize your team‚Äôs work
-------------------------------------

Give your team a shared place to collaborate and progress important projects ‚Äì¬†alongside but separate from their personal to-dos.

*   Project layouts are flexible, so you can switch between board, calendar or list to track progress and deliver projects on time.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

#### What‚Äôs the difference between the Pro and Business plans?

The Business plan includes all of the features of the Pro plan ‚Äî like reminders, filters, and more ‚Äî in addition to a few handy capabilities for team users and admins:

**All team members will be able to:**

*   Browse and preview public team projects and join only the ones that are relevant to them.
*   Share direct links to projects, sections, tasks, and comments that teammates can preview and instantly take action on.
*   Group or filter tasks by personal and/or team projects from the View Options menu in Today, Upcoming, and filter views to better separate work and life.

**For team leaders, adding a team to Todoist:**

*   Gives you a transparent, organized overview of all your team‚Äôs work and lets you pop in to see progress, without having to join each and every individual project.
*   Makes data ownership crystal clear. Team projects belong to the team. Personal projects belong to the individual.
*   Grants admins more control over permissions and data access in team settings.

Plus, when you upgrade your team to [the Business plan](https://todoist.com/pricing), all members automatically get access to all personal Pro features ‚Äì like reminders, calendar layout for projects, and task durations!

(After all, when your teammates are organized and on top of their personal to-dos, teamwork magically tends to flow more smoothly, too. üíÜ)

You can view a full overview of what is included with each plan on our [pricing page](https://todoist.com/pricing).

#### What if I want to keep using Todoist for personal task management?

You absolutely can! The simple yet powerful personal task manager you know and love isn‚Äôt going anywhere. As with all of Todoist‚Äôs power features, these team features are there when you need them and out of the way when you don‚Äôt. Your personal projects stay private and in your full control, even when you're collaborating with a team in a shared workspace.

#### Can I create more than one team?

Yes! There are no limits to the amount of paid teams you can create.

However, billing is per team. If you have the same person in two different paid teams, you‚Äôd be paying twice for that person. This means that separate teams are best used when interacting with completely distinct groups ‚Äî like clients, vendors, or partner organizations ‚Äî with no crossover.

Instead of creating new teams, you may choose to use [Folders](https://todoist.com/help/articles/use-folders-to-organize-team-projects-uoElGQdbb) and [restricted projects](https://todoist.com/help/articles/create-a-restricted-project-in-todoist-Z3xRrlNLc) to group and organize team efforts... in fact, that's how we do it ourselves.

#### What is included in my team?

You can go [here](https://todoist.com/help/articles/usage-limits-in-todoist-e5rcSY) to see a full overview of the features and limits for each team plan.

#### What‚Äôs the difference between a team admin, member, and guest?

[This article](https://todoist.com/help/articles/team-roles-and-access-uGkyLrJQz) explains in detail what the difference is between being an admin, a member, or a guest of a team.

#### What makes teams different from shared projects?

Shared projects can be great for ad hoc collaboration, but when you work with the same group of people who all need access to the same projects and information, one-off shared projects leave a lot to be desired. Now there's a dedicated home for your team's work.

In a team:

*   All members can browse and preview projects on their own, or preview and join projects via link. No more manually inviting people, one-by-one, to join shared projects.
*   Every member can keep track of important projects in the team workspace, while maintaining a completely separate space for their personal data. Custom filters allow for the mix of work and personal tasks that's right for each individual.
*   Referencing projects, sections, and tasks is as easy as sharing a link.
*   Data ownership ‚Äî what belongs to the team and what belongs to individuals ‚Äî is crystal clear. Team projects belong to the team and personal projects stay private ‚Äî even if you leave the team.
*   Admins can control access, manage roles, and get an overview of the team's activity.

And there's more to come ‚Äî we'll continue to add more collaborative features based on real-world feedback from teams like yours.

#### Can I invite people outside my organization to a team project?

Absolutely. People outside of your organization can be invited to specific projects as guests, for free.
