Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Find answers to your questions right here, and don't hesitate to

contact us

if you couldn't find what you're looking for.

### Can I upgrade myself or do I have to upgrade my entire Workspace?

To upgrade ClickUp, you'll need to upgrade your entire Workspace, which means all members in your Workspace.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards! For Enterprise orders meeting a minimum we also accept bank transfers.

### What is your refund policy?

We have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If for any reason, you're not satisfied with your purchase, simply let us know within 30 days and we'll be happy to issue you a full refund.

### How am I billed when I add paid users to a Workspace?

ClickUp automatically bills you at a prorated price based on the time left in your cycle for any paid users added to your Workspace. Paid users include members and internal guests.

### What if I have multiple Workspaces?

Payment is per Workspace, meaning each Workspace requires an individual upgrade.

### What happens if I cancel?

You're free to cancel at anytime!

### Do you offer discounts for nonprofits, students, educators, or startups?

Yes to all of the above! Check out the resources below for more information:

*   For nonprofits, head to [this link](https://clickup.com/teams/non-profit) and click the "Claim your nonprofit discount" button to get started
*   For students, educators, and administrators, head to [this link](https://clickup.com/teams/student) and click the "Claim your academic discount" button to get started
*   For startups, fill out and submit [this form](https://dev-forms.clickup.com/f/ad-60211/6B2FSBNQSKZEJWR8A2) to apply for a startup credit, or head to [this page](https://clickup.com/teams/startup) for more info

### Do you have a public roadmap?

We certainly do! You can find it [here](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6327807151639-Roadmap?_gl=1*17bek8q*_gcl_au*MTc1MTU4NzI1OS4xNjg0Mjc4Mjc0LjE2NTU4OTEzNC4xNjg0NTM5NTU4LjE2ODQ1Mzk1NTc.).

### Is the Free Forever Plan really free?

For sure! This is so much more than a trial. The Free Forever Plan offers an unmatched level of functionality compared to other 'freemium' apps. We do this by making money on our paid plans.

### How do I change my plan if I start on the Free Forever Plan?

Once you've created a team, we built a handy billing area to take care of all plan, cycle, and payment details.

### Do tasks count against my storage?

No! File attachments are the only things that affect your team's storage.

### What is a "use" in context of ClickUp's plans?

"Uses" are intended as a demonstration of paid plan features, allowing you to explore their value for your workflows. Uses are cumulative throughout a Workspace and they do not reset or count down. When you reach a use limit, you won't lose any data, but you won't be able to edit or create new items with that feature. You can find a breakdown which features have usage limits [here](https://clickup.com/pricing).

### What happens when I hit my usage limits?

You'll still be able to use ClickUp, and we'll let you know as soon as a limit is reached. We're happy to provide a grace period to find the plan that works for you!

### Does adding Guests to my Workspace affect my plan or how I'm billed?

Free Forever Workspaces can have an unlimited number of members and guests at no charge. On the Free Forever Plan, guests have full create and edit permissions, which cannot be modified. Workspaces on a paid plan start with a limited number of external guest seats and unlimited read-only guests. The paid plan guest seats are as follows:

*   Unlimited Plan: receive 5 guest seats for a 1 paid user Workspace and 2 guest seats for each additional paid user you invite to your Workspace
*   Business Plan: receive 10 guest seats for a 1 paid user Workspace and 5 guest seats for each additional paid user you invite to your Workspace
*   Enterprise Plan: receives the same number of guest seats as the Business Plan, with advanced permissions options

Guests are intended for users external to your organization, if you add people inside your organization as guests they will be billed as paid users.

Head to this [Support Doc](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/6310022323991-Guests-overview) to learn more about guest seats and guest permissions.
