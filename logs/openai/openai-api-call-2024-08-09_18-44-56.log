### Resolve live chat inquiries with AI Answers

New

Plan add-on

at $0.70/resolution

### What’s a resolution?

AI Answers is measured in resolutions, which means you only pay when a live chat inquiry is resolved by AI, rather than by your team.

A resolution is counted when a chat conversation ends after an AI response and the customer either:

*   Selects **Yes** for the confirmation question “Did that answer your question?”
*   Leaves the chat without selecting an answer to the confirmation question

Instantly resolve Front Chat inquiries with AI responses based on your help content.

How teams deliver exceptional service at scale
==============================================

Front is a new way to route, respond to, and measure all your customer conversations.

Does this sound familiar?
-------------------------

![Image 2](https://front.com/assets/pages/product-2023/glyphs/shared-inbox.svg)

We’re overwhelmed with too many inbound messages

![Image 3](https://front.com/assets/pages/product-2023/glyphs/insights-analytics.svg)

Our teams need to collaborate more easily

![Image 4](https://front.com/assets/pages/product-2023/glyphs/team-collaboration.svg)

We struggle to scale and maintain personalization

![Image 5](https://front.com/assets/pages/product-2023/glyphs/live-chat.svg)

We want to track and improve customer experience

In comes Front. Wow every customer with fast, accurate, and human responses.

Get every message into the right hands without manual work
----------------------------------------------------------

1.  Centralize your channels
    
    Goodbye, tab juggling. Funnel all of your inbound messages from email, social media, SMS, voice, and more into a single place.
    
2.  Route messages automatically
    
    Get messages to the right person by setting rules based on message content (like keywords) or data from other systems (like account info from Salesforce). No forwarding or distribution lists necessary.
    
3.  Assign clear ownership
    
    There’s no question about who’s responsible for following up when messages are automatically assigned to individual owners based on availability, expertise, or workload.
    
4.  Let tags do the work
    
    Label messages with tags for pulling reports, quick visual cues, powering rules, or filtering searches.
    

Craft stellar customer responses with built-in collaboration and context
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Draft responses together in Front
    
    Gone are the days of “Can someone start a new doc?” With shared drafts directly in Front, teams can collaborate on customer responses without using a separate tool.
    
2.  Loop in teammates without endless threads
    
    Comment internally on customer messages to share visibility and collaborate behind-the-scenes. Don’t sweat — your client won’t see anything other than the completed reply from your team.
    
3.  See customer history and data alongside the conversation
    
    Front integrates with 3rd party platforms — pulling in customer history, past conversations, and account info — so you have everything you need to personalize responses in one simple view.
    

Gain insights and optimize workflows to boost customer satisfaction
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Keep reply time low and satisfaction high
    
    Stay on top of SLA breaches and leading customer metrics, like response time and CSAT.
    
2.  Investigate processes and share visibility
    
    From birds-eye views to individual conversations, give managers, admins, and stakeholders the visibility they need to understand customer health.
    
3.  Improve people and team performance
    
    Get insights and reports on individual or team performance, surfacing what processes need love or which teammates need a bonus.
