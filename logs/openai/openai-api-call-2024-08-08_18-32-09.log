Fair pricingAll Crisp plans have been designed to fit most business needs. Our prices are flat and transparent so you can easily plan your spending.

Cancel anytimeCancel anytime, after you subscribe to a plan. You are only committed to paying the month you subscribed to, and no further.

Consolidated billingCrisp bills you once per month, per payment method. We accept most credit cards, as well as PayPal. All bills are consolidated across workspaces.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Will I pay more for some features?

Yes. We may provide some additional features that are not included in your plan, which you can subscribe to, but that's your choice to opt-in for them (eg. paid integrations for specific systems, additional contacts or more than 20 agents in your inbox).

  

### Is VAT included in plan prices?

VAT is not included in our plan prices. As most Crisp customers are businesses, they do not owe VAT and thus we charge the advertised flat price. VAT is still due for consumers and may be applied on all plan prices (ie. non-business entities).

  

  
If you are an EU business, make sure you enter your EU VAT number to prove your business status and thus remove VAT from the price. If you are located outside the EU, we won't charge any VAT, regardless of your business or consumer status.

  

### Do you offer discounts on multiple Crisp Workspaces?

Yes! We offer discounts if you are taking multiple paid Crisp Workspaces (Crisp Unlimited only) under the same account. We offer 20% off for 3 additional inboxes. This means if you have multiple workspaces (different teams) you can have separate inboxes for each team under one Crisp account. Come chat with us!

  

### What does a Crisp Workspace stand for?

A Crisp Workspace is another name for a "team inbox", into which you can invite operators to collaborate and answer customer questions.

  

  
A Crisp workspace is tied to a specific livechat identifier, which you can install on one or multiple domains (eg: website.com, sub.website.com, etc). It is not tied to a single domain. Plans are billed per-crisp workspace, so you only pay per livechat identifier, not per domain and sub-domains.

  

  
As an example, you can have one Crisp workspace (team) and install the live chat on multiple domains (which would constitute one plan). If you operate multiple businesses and wish to have multiple separate Crisp workspaces then you can simply switch between workspaces seamlessly.

  

  
One subscription equals one workspace and allows for integrations with many channels: Instagram, emails, Messenger, or Whatsapp can be centralized in one workspace.

  

### I’m running a nonprofit / I am a student. Do you offer discounts?

We offer a 50% discount for nonprofits and students. Chat with us to get your promo code.

  

### Is it possible to pay yearly?

Yes, it is possible! You can enable yearly payment mode on your Plans page in the Crisp app after you subscribed to a plan (click on the Monthly button, which then becomes Yearly once saved).

  

### Why are there no limits on the number of messages?

At Crisp, we believe existing chat platforms are still locked in the past. Why would we bill based on consumption (as all others do), while we are used to unlimited plans everywhere else (mobile carriers, Internet access providers, etc.)? Unlimited is peace of mind at the end of the month; this allows you to allocate more energy to your core business rather than petty subscription policies.
