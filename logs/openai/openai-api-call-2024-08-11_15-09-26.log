Work together, even when you're apart
-------------------------------------

Proximity shouldn't limit the effectiveness of your team. Zoho Sheet lets you share your spreadsheets and enjoy real-time collaboration with your team, by creating boundless cloud-based workplaces.

![Image 1: work together](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-collaboration-work-together.png)

Edit in real time
-----------------

Zoho Sheet not only allows collaborators to make changes to your spreadsheet, but also keeps you in the loop while they do it. View changes as they're being made, and track them for future reference.

![Image 2: See real time edits made by collaborators to the spread](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-collaboration-edit-in-real-time.jpg)

Comment contextually
--------------------

Make a comment on a specific cell, a range of cells, or the sheet as a whole—and use @mentions to ensure they always get noticed by the person they're intended for. Once handled, just resolve the comment to hide it, leaving unresolved comments visible and open for further discussion.

Keep the team in the loop
-------------------------

Speaking of discussions, the group chat option in Zoho Sheet allows all collaborators to express their opinions. If there's something everyone, or a group of specific collaborators, needs to know, the Notify Collaborators feature helps you get the message across via email.

![Image 3: features-collaboration-keep-the-team-in-the-loop-group-chat](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-collaboration-keep-the-team-in-the-loop-group-chat.jpg)

Spreadsheets made secure
------------------------

Keep control of your shared data by limiting access to your spreadsheet. Lock all or specific collaborators out of cell ranges, or entire sheets, to prevent accidental edits. Review changes with Audit Trail, and revisit or revert to older versions of your file with Version History. All these features give you control over your data.

Efficient tools for better data analysis

[Try Zoho Sheet now](https://www.zoho.com/sheet/signup.html)

Vibrant charts to visualize data
--------------------------------

With over thirty-five different chart types available, you can find the best way to visualize almost any datatype. Create and customize elegant charts with unique color schemes.

![Image 1: Sheet Screenshot Analysis](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/screen-shot-2019-02-07-at-3.05.09-pm.png)

Pivot Table: The data summarizer
--------------------------------

Pivot tables help you find the needle in the haystack. If you have a lot of data on your hands and want to make sense of it, pivot tables are the way to do it. They pull the desired reports and summaries out of your datasets to help you understand your data more easily.

Conditional formats
-------------------

Conditional formats make any data presentable. The formatting can be a color scale, an icon, or even a custom format, applied to a set of cells. Cells that match specified conditions will be formatted accordingly, making them stand out in a sheet full of cells. [Learn more](https://www.zoho.com/sheet/conditional-formatting.html)

Sparklines
----------

Sparklines are in-cell charts that'll help you visualize data rows. They are completely customizable, from the color, to the chart type, to the axes.

![Image 6: Analyze Sparklines](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-analyze-sparklines1.png)

Sort and filter to save time
----------------------------

Sort the data and filter the results to get your hands on exactly what you need. Save the time you’d spend scrolling through rows and rows of unorganized numbers.

Fine-grained controls for flawless collaboration
================================================

Your spreadsheet shared on your terms.

[Try Zoho Sheet now!](https://www.zoho.com/sheet/signup.html)

Different permissions. Different access.
----------------------------------------

Sharing your spreadsheet with people demands an additional layer of protection. With Zoho Sheet, you can choose the level of control a collaborator has over your document. This can be revoked at any time, by simply removing their name from the list of collaborators.

![Image 1: features-user-controls-difference-permissions-different-accesses](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-user-controls-difference-permissions-different-accesses.png)

Contextual locks for better control
-----------------------------------

Lock a sheet or a range of cells to avoid accidental edits or to limit access to specific collaborators. This keeps you in control of your data, and lets you choose who can or cannot edit specific parts of your spreadsheet.

![Image 2: User level and cells level locks to prevent accidental data loss.](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-user-controls-.jpg)

Check out to prevent edits
--------------------------

Checking out of a spreadsheet will immediately make it read-only for all other users, irrespective of their permissions. The edits that you make will be inaccessible to them as well, until you're checked in again. This allows you to work on the spreadsheet, or have a closer look at it, without any parallel edits.

![Image 3: Check-out to keep clear of edits](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/keep-clear-of-edits.jpg)

Audit trail: Data detective
---------------------------

More hands on deck means faster work—but it's exhausting to manually track who made which edits to your spreadsheet. Audit Trail helps keep track of changes made to the spreadsheet by a particular collaborator, on a particular date, or to a particular sheet or range of cells in the spreadsheet.

![Image 4: audit-trial](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/audit-trail-1-shadow.png)

Revise, revisit, restore
------------------------

Zoho Sheet automatically saves versions of your spreadsheet, giving you the chance to go back to old copies—just in case there's a need to check or restore a previous version. Changes made to the spreadsheet on a specific version can be singled out and viewed as well.  In addition to the automatically saved versions, new versions can be created and named manually.

![Image 5: user-control](https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/zweb/images/sheet/features-user-controls-revise-rev.jpg)

Zia: Your personal data analyst
===============================

A lot of times, data representation becomes a bigger task than the data collection itself. That's when your personal data analyst, Zia comes to the rescue. Watch a Video

[Sign up for free](https://www.zoho.com/sheet/signup.html?changeservice=change)

Zia helps you visualize data
----------------------------

There's little use in having rows and rows of data if people can't make sense of it. Charts have long been the traditional way of organizing and representing data. As your intelligent data analyst, Zia will recommend charts (or aggregate them depending on your data,) that you can add to your spreadsheet with a simple drag-and-drop action.

Zia builds the best pivot tables
--------------------------------

When data seems too vast for a chart, it can be confined to a table. Zia will scan data, group it, and then put it into pivot tables. These tables provide compressed summaries of all your data. Drag-and-drop options simplify the process of creating pivot tables.

Ask Zia questions about your data
---------------------------------

Ask Zia questions about your data, just like you would with your data analyst, in plain and simple English. Zia will help you understand the answer through charts, pivots, or formulas, so you can arrive at solutions more easily in the future.

All you need is a second opinion
--------------------------------

Zia, in addition to charts and pivots, will also provide insights for you to better understand your data. The larger the data sets, the more accurate these insights get.

Zia is mobile friendly.
-----------------------

How helpful would it be to have a data assistant in your pocket all the time? That's what it’s like when you install the iOS or Android apps for Zoho Sheet. These applications have Zia built in, to help you solve all your data issues, from the simplest to the most complex. You don't even have to type in your questions. Simply ask them aloud to Zia.

With artificial intelligence, turn data into information.
