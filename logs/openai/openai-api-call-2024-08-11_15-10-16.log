Asana Starter plan
==================

Streamline the way you work so your team can track projects and hit deadlines with ease.

[Get started](https://asana.com/create-account)[View demo](https://asana.com/go/demo)

![Image 13](blob:https://asana.com/9911378f5e25a5a7858b3e5682e03f60)![Image 14: Track progress with Asana Gantt view](blob:https://asana.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

DRIVE CLARITY & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Track progress at a glance

##### Gantt view

Get this project-management staple to help you map out larger projects and compare original plans against real-time progress.

##### Timeline view

See how all your work fits together so you can kick off projects on the right foot and deliver them on time.

##### Milestones

Mark specific points along a project’s timeline that signify different phases of work and whether or not it’s on track.

##### Project dashboards

Use graphs and data visualizations to help you get a quick pulse on progress and identify potential blockers.

MAXIMIZE IMPACT

### Automate busywork so you can focus on work that matters most

##### Workflow builder

Coordinate work seamlessly across teams by automating processes and connecting the right people with the right information.

##### Custom project templates

If your team has work they repeat, you can create custom templates so they don’t have to start from scratch every time.

##### Forms

Use forms to standardize the way work gets kicked off and quickly gather the information you need for any given project.

##### Rules

Set rules to take care of routine tasks. Just assign a trigger that activates an action, like automatically assigning a task when a due date is set.

> Asana made a major impact on Vox Creative. I don't know how we would do it if it weren't all in a centralized place. We wouldn't have gotten to this place in our business without it, quite honestly.

FAQ

### Got more questions? We’ve got answers.

##### What are the benefits of upgrading from Asana Personal to Asana Starter?

The Starter plan gives growing teams the features they need to enable collaboration between teammates, track project progress, and hit deadlines.

At the Starter level, you get all of the personal features in addition to access to workflows, automations, and project views like Gantt and timeline.

##### What additional controls and security features do you offer in Starter vs Personal?

By upgrading to Starter, you’ll get:

*   Comment-only projects
    
*   Private projects
    
*   Hidden teams
    
*   Unlimited free guests
    
*   Google SSO
    
*   Admin console
    
*   Org-wide password reset
    
*   3 levels of access for projects: admin, editor, and commenter
    
*   Team admins can:
    
    *   Restrict team members from editing the team name
        
    *   Restrict team members from editing the team description
        
    *   Restrict team members from deleting the team
        
    *   Restrict team members from editing the team privacy type
        

##### How do I know if Starter is right for my team?

Every organization is different, and the benefits of Starter can be harnessed by teams small and large, whether they’re just starting or have used Asana for a while.

Here are a few key indicators that your team would benefit from Starter:

*   If you are on a team of more than 10 people and up to 500
    
*   If you are a project manager (or manage projects as part of your job)
    
*   If you have work that needs to be reported on
    
*   If you regularly repeat projects or processes (templatizing work)
    
*   If you have complex or detailed workflows
    
*   If you work with lots of different teams across your organization
    
*   If you work at a large company\*
    
*   If you’re putting sensitive information into Asana\*
    
*   If you need help onboarding your team to Asana\*
    

_\* Larger teams, entire organizations, or those looking for even more powerful Asana features and support options should consider our_ [_Enterprise_](https://asana.com/enterprise) _offerings._

##### What are the best features included in the Starter plan?

The Starter plan gives you access to powerful features like:

*   Timeline view
    
*   Gantt view
    
*   Forms
    
*   Custom project templates
    
*   Task templates
    
*   Dependencies
    
*   Workflow builder
    

##### Can you mix Personal and Starter users in a single plan?

If you have an organization, you could upgrade a specific team to Starter and invite only the users who need access to Starter to the team. By doing so, the rest of the teams in your organization will remain using the Personal version of Asana. You can learn more about upgrading [here](https://help.asana.com/hc/en-us/articles/14108488926619-Upgrade-and-billing#sts=Paid%20Organization%20vs%20Paid%20Team).

##### What additional security features do you offer for Starter?

Security is a top priority for us. We offer a high level of security for both free and paid customers. To learn more about how we protect your data, check out our [Security Statement](https://asana.com/trust), [Privacy Statement](https://asana.com/terms#privacy-statement), and the related section of the [Asana Guide](https://help.asana.com/hc/en-us/articles/14139896860955-Privacy-and-security).

FAQ

### Got more questions? We’ve got answers.

##### What are the benefits of upgrading from Starter to Advanced?

If you’ve begun a trial or recently upgraded to Advanced, there are a few things you should try out right away. First, you’ve now got access to many new features not available in Starter: goals to help manage OKRs, portfolios to gain an overview of your team’s work, workload to manage your team’s capacity, and proofing and approvals to streamline the review process.

Advanced unlocks additional functionalities within some features that Starter users will already be familiar with. Rules benefit from the addition of the custom rule builder for more intricate workflows and automations, while custom fields receive the ability to lock a field’s settings even when used across the organization. Integrations with Jira Cloud Data Sync, ServiceNow and Adobe Creative Cloud bring your team or organization's Asana data to life, and forms with branching logic aid the intake and triage of requests in powerful new ways.

##### What additional security features do you offer for Advanced?

Security is a top priority for us. We offer a high level of security for both free and paid customers.

Every organization is different, and the benefits of Advanced can be harnessed by teams small and large, whether they’re just starting or have used Asana for a while. Here are a few key indicators Advanced is a good fit:

*   If you are a project manager, team lead, or department head using Asana to plan and manage work

*   If you have work that needs to be reported on to executives
    
*   If you are responsible for planning and managing your team’s workload and schedule
    
*   If you plan on using Asana company-wide\* or cross-functionally
    
*   If you need to understand how major projects are progressing towards KPIs and objectives
