Trello 101

A productivity powerhouse
-------------------------

Simple, flexible, and powerful. All it takes are boards, lists, and cards to get a clear view of who’s doing what and what needs to get done. Learn more in our [guide for getting started](https://trello.com/guide).

### Boards

Trello boards keep tasks organized and work moving forward. In a glance, see everything from “things to do” to “aww yeah, we did it!”

### Lists

The different stages of a task. Start as simple as To Do, Doing or Done—or build a workflow custom fit to your team’s needs. There’s no wrong way to Trello.

### Cards

Cards represent tasks and ideas and hold all the information to get the job done. As you make progress, move cards across lists to show their status.
