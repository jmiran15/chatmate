I’m responsible for our chat platform and channel service strategy. The reason why we moved to Freshworks was for the APIs so that we can be our own chat client. I really enjoyed the collaboration.

Freshdesk has scaled with us. What I love most is that I don't need an administrator to maintain it. Ticket automation, screen-share through the chat, customized portals for different segments of our users—all those things are really helping us bring response times down.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### How does the 14-day free trial work?

After you sign up, you can access all the features in the Enterprise Plan for 14 days. We want to make sure that you are completely satisfied with Freshdesk before you buy the product. At any point during your trial, you can add your credit card to purchase any plan of your choice.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription?

Yes, you can choose to upgrade your subscription instantly. If you wish to downgrade or cancel your subscription, you can do so at the end of your term. Click on ‘Plans & Billing’ in your Freshdesk account to modify your subscription details.

### How safe is my data?

We take security seriously and you get to choose your data center from the get-go. Our servers are hosted in world-class data centers that are protected by biometric locks and 24-hour surveillance. We ensure that our application is always up to date with the latest security patches. All Freshdesk plans include SSL for encryption, for FREE, to keep your data safe.

### What is Freddy AI?

Freddy AI is a user-friendly AI solution that boosts productivity, fosters innovation, and delivers personalized customer experiences with its powerful generative AI capabilities. To learn more about Freddy, [click here](https://www.freshworks.com/freddy-ai/).

### What does beta mean for Freddy Insights?

The beta program aims to help more customers try out our AI offerings. We also want to maximize customer feedback and fine-tune our features before we launch them publicly.

### What is a session in Freddy Self Service?

A session is any unique interaction between an end-user and a bot:

\- On email, every email response is counted as 1 bot session

\- On voice, every voice bot response is counted as 1 bot session

\- On chat, all end-users-to-bot interactions that happen within a span of 24 hours from the time end-users initiate a session are counted as 1 bot session

\- Only customer-facing AI features and bots consume sessions. Agent-facing AI features and bots don’t consume bot sessions.

### Do I get free sessions on any plan?

We offer 500 sessions with all paid plans to try out Freddy Self Service chatbots. This is limited to once per account. Once exhausted, you need to buy additional sessions based on your requirements.

### Do you have any cancellation fees?

No. Freshdesk is a pay-as-you-go service. We do not have any cancellation fees. You can cancel whenever you want but your cancellation will come into effect only after the end of your term.

### What types of payment do you accept?

We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. We do not accept PayPal. We will not be able to accept purchase orders over the phone. All of our offline payments follow USD pricing.
