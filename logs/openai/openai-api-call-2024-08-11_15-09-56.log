Got a process to track? Need to watch stuff move through stages? Basecamp’s **Card Table** is what you need. It’s our unique take on kanban. ![Image 11: How Basecamp Works](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/how-basecamp-works-d0df3dce13b89e6c05f4f39db1195710cab0c0d6d3e22f4dae55a27eb92080f8.png)

Overseeing multiple projects? You could open each one to check its status. But there’s a better way to get the big picture view — it’s called **Mission Control.**

### Leave the grind behind.  
Glide through projects instead.

It’s a struggle to juggle people, projects, clients, deadlines, and expectations — especially when you’re the [underdog](https://basecamp.com/underdogs) competing against larger companies. We’re like you, we get it. That’s [why we built Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about).

**In Basecamp, each project lives on a single page.** With everything in reach, and every piece of information tracked and organized, everyone knows where to find what they need, and say what they need to say.

Here’s what project management in Basecamp looks like:

### Not everything under the sun,  
just the stuff to get things done.

Besides unlimited projects, you’ll get [pings](https://basecamp.com/features/pings) for private conversations, [reports](https://basecamp.com/features/activity-reports) to summarize the essentials, [notification protections](https://basecamp.com/features/notification-settings) so you aren’t constantly distracted, a [timeline](https://basecamp.com/features/lineup) showing you everything that’s happening, [exceptional customer service](https://basecamp.com/support), and [plenty more](https://basecamp.com/features) to round it out.

**Basecamp also helps you consolidate billing, cut costs, and simplify onboarding.** When you use Basecamp you don’t need separate apps for chat, file sharing, tasks, or basic scheduling. No more bouncing around, losing stuff, wondering where someone put something, paying multiple bills or onboarding people in multiple places. **Less isn’t more, it’s better.**

 ![Image 31: Chat](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/chat-7f225de247735062bbc27773e3b3316dc5357a45133f6cd97afdd826a0f942b2.png)

With real-time **Chat** built into every Basecamp project, you can ditch whatever separate chat app you’re using (and save money, too). ![Image 32: Timesheet](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/timesheet-5595838a493dc64bd1f72f6d42abfee8729309953ccea6367e4178dd610419f5.png)

With the **Timesheet** add-on, you can track time directly in Basecamp — no spreadsheets required. ![Image 33: Lineup](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/lineup-46c1263f0a408b7a43553b90c41b8cd708f21e986227a643da7201f56c4c0c45.png)

Basecamp’s **Lineup** shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once, on a single timeline. So clear.

Watch how **a team of two organized and managed a company offsite for 80 people** — simply using Basecamp for project management.

 ![Image 35: To-dos](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/to-dos-23a1f28ac24fc786dad5f71d31df136f3ce0e544ba98d7db4a5564b978611b4e.png)

**To-dos** are straightforward, simple, and clear. Make lists, add items, delegate, discuss, and stay in the loop as work gets done (or know when it doesn’t). ![Image 36: Doors](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/doors-dc5ac6aef6d9f78c1a2b4339578cee6dd8777f76c6fa2c85acf7b4aca4387658.png)

Use a few other products too? No problem — **Doors** let you link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s tools. ![Image 37: Schedule](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/schedule-1537889b2c251a0db8a4d7283d2c39fde62212df6c446328a9fcc2a5c503d8d9.png)

**Schedule** events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything. Pull them right into the calendar of your choice, too.

![Image 38](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/illustration/bubbles-366b434f9042d631a47c91b96e28c551bd774ba512d97c737016592fcedf6033.svg)

### The top choice of savvy teams looking for a big advantage.

Used by top notch **marketers**, ad agencies, designers, **client services firms**, consultants, **software developers**, freelancers, **PR agencies**, contractors, schools, **non-profits**, first responders, and many others. **Over 75,000 organizations, across every industry imaginable, in 166 countries, use Basecamp for project management.**

> “I’ve used Basecamp for a million projects over the last decade and a half. **It’s beautiful software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the things that mattered most.** Highly recommended.” —Tobi Lütke, CEO, Shopify

 ![Image 39: Watch “Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell”](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/hilary-fitzgerald-campbell-85fde1fc2614ced5db697c9cab97ee82819bc87b271238fd59e400c52d907dec.png)

Hilary Fitzgerald Campbell, a cartoonist for The New Yorker, used to keep her client notes, doodles, ideas, and invoicing scribbled on post-its, napkins, a pile of sketchbooks, emails and texts — **then she discovered Basecamp for project management.**

 ![Image 40: Message Board](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/message-board-d7b714967ccdb96ce0695d642daa0fa30ed5292803f6db86e1ba34e7362803e6.png)

Instead of blasting emails across your organization, post messages on a centralized **Message Board** instead. Keep conversations centralized, organised, and accessible. ![Image 41: Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/hill-charts-3bd886ed7b0869f4f0b58a95dc706a9005cfec8f4850f37d1b285a3f134de534.png)

Instead of wondering what “73% done” really means, Basecamp’s **Hill Charts** give you a visual, intuitive sense of where projects really stand. ![Image 42: Docs & Files](https://basecamp.com/assets/uo/transition/docs-and-files-317fe71d1239a90930ac3e054c59b7fdf038e20dbe125e8e668ea79b98fd81b6.png)

Every project has its own **Docs & Files** library to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Even if they’re in the cloud on other services.

### Change for the better.

We asked our customers **“What changed for the better since you switched to Basecamp for project management?”** [Thousands responded](https://basecamp.com/customers), here’s some of what they said:

> “For the first time in a long time our team is truly collaborating, and everyone is moving in the same direction, with the same goals. It’s truly remarkable how quickly things have changed in just a week.”Ryan Sullivan,  
> WP Site Care

> “This is the first time that the people in the organization are actually using project management app. And not looking at it as if it was a nuisance. It’s a tool, and a good one.”Evgeny Viner,  
> Leadux GmbH

> “We are consistently meeting deadlines because all the facts, files and comments are in one place. And everyone is accountable for their contribution to the project. Very user friendly.”Kim Curry,  
> Kim Curry Design

> “We have actually accomplished things that have been waiting forever to get done.”Danek Coffey,  
> Coffey LLC

> “Our company has grown immensely in organization and efficiency. We have everything organized according to clients, projects, employees, etc., resulting in clear and concise communication.”Katie Greathouse,

> LATE Nation & Gareth Emery

> “Before Basecamp, I ran my freelance web development business basically from a spreadsheet, then I moved to Basecamp and my life is so much less stressful. Basecamp has increased my happiness exponentially.”Patrick Krebs,  
> Sad Robot Software

> “I feel like I am better organized and more efficient because of Basecamp. It has also greatly increased our ability to collaborate on projects large or small and have a better idea of the project and all of its pieces, rather than just what I am responsible for.”Alex Jackson,  
> Luther College

> “I no longer have to wonder whether I’ve asked for something to be done or whether it has in fact been done. Every member of my team is more accountable than we were before Basecamp.”John Drover,  
> Roebothan McKay Marshall

Timesheets

With the “Timesheet” add-on, you can track time directly in Basecamp — no spreadsheets required.

 ![Image 43: Timesheet](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/timesheet-framed-d0aa82080a6627a2cf790fd7cd8394f3d31464ccea527f065d78fb762e46cb9a.png)

View and filter timesheets across the account, and **export the results as a CSV file.**

Mission Control

Mission Control shows you which projects are on track and which ones need a helping hand.

 ![Image 44: Mission Control](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/mission-control-6fa68c1548ce67a89f5a7a0c85e8d27e9ceff6a6f7cdbdac494941a06f63f0da.png)

Chat

Basecamp has chat built in so you don’t need to pay for a separate chat service like Slack.

 ![Image 45: Chat](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/chat-framed-bd808562261cf1315081b8545ebf5d7765c50aa22e4392522bb16264cea652f5.png)

Card Table

Card Tables are for tracking work that moves through stages. It’s like kanban, only better.

 ![Image 46: Card Table](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/card-table-framed-9618518ce195addd7fd0adb6fdba8571cbef5d7a5b35ee37fbb5b76c26280931.png)

Not everyone needs to know about things as they happen. **Basecamp only notifies the people who need to know**, so no one’s unnecessarily distracted.

Docs & Files

Every project includes space to organize, share, and store docs, files, and images. Cloud or local.

 ![Image 47: Docs & Files](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/docs-and-files-framed-00a9ea4176897b3e9fc1ddce249c07d8a59305fa0bc21f42c75a8f0b2a498546.png)

Message Board

Keep the entire conversation about a specific topic together on a single page.

 ![Image 48: Message Board](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/message-board-framed-2bb414920305bff92430b33f0d797f41eec6ea810d8311a84eb65741f915e1d0.png)

In Basecamp, **everyone sees the same version of the full conversation**. This way everyone’s always on the same page. No more forwarding emails to bring people up to speed.

Since not everyone needs to know about things as they happen. **Basecamp only notifies the people who need to know**, so no one’s unnecessarily distracted.

Schedule

Set up events, deadlines, and milestones so no one misses anything important — ever.

 ![Image 49: Schedule](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/schedule-framed-fd697885dbecef0c806e10ca457ef89b5381274aa7d182cfa177ef05c4938366.png)

To-dos

The powerful place to track work, deadlines, responsibilities, progress, and details.

 ![Image 50: To-dos](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/to-dos-framed-e889382bf8632c88ba9dfa64266d3432161f2a0e8c75dc31cafbcad64109cbaf.png)

Instantly understandable, impossibly powerful, Basecamp’s to-do lists do much of the heavy lifting for you.

Make as many lists as you want, assign as many people as you need, be notified when things are late or complete. It’s the full package in the simplest form.

We invented “Hill Charts” to give you a visual, intuitive sense of where projects really stand.

 ![Image 51: Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/hill-charts-1d43238ad79fd90fe0e868aefc7a695f812544273d4f592c6bc81206446230ea.png)

Progress is more like a hill than a straight line. Basecamp-exclusive **Hill Charts provide a unique look into what remains** to figure out (uphill), and what’s in production (downhill). [Hmm, tell me more](https://basecamp.com/hill-charts).

Invented here, and only available in Basecamp, Hill Charts are game changers. Once you use them you’ll never want to work without them again.

“The Lineup” shows you where every project stands, from start to finish, all at once.

 ![Image 52: Lineup](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/lineup-framed-6a6306f99130a7e4910c453f2dad0ac1e1946a63893ebcf79fde882ac4236273.png)

**Today’s always the line right down the middle**, and each project has a start and end date on either end. This way you can _see_ how much time remains on each one, relative to today, in a single glance.

Add a “Door” and link up other services you use right alongside Basecamp’s built-in tools.

 ![Image 53: Doors](https://basecamp.com/assets/screenshots/doors-framed-714b618bc7551a8c9f19fba132393f1c6cca1e06901125abaeea900893082d72.png)

Change for the better.
======================

We asked our customers **“What changed for the better since you switched to Basecamp?”** Thousands responded, here’s some of what they said.

> Since we’ve been using Basecamp, our communication is drastically better and deadlines are met without drama. –Shannon Kropf, Full Sail University

> We have actually accomplished things that have been waiting forever to get done. –Danek Coffey, Coffey LLC

> Everyone’s on the same page. Many of our people are not very organized naturally, so basecamp is a godsend. –Anirvachan Vasan, APEX

> Our company has grown immensely in organization and efficiency. We have everything organized according to clients, projects, employees, etc., resulting in clear and concise communication amongst employees and with clients. –Katie Greathouse, Health Economic Advisors Inc.

> Different time-zones are no longer an insurmountable obstacle. –Stefano, AddressAdvisor.com

> Because the platform we used previously was so cumbersome and time-intensive to maintain, we used to have a person dedicated almost exclusively to managing the marketing production workflow for our three brands. Now I spend about an hour a month setting things up, and the process manages itself. –Sean Hay, One Click

> I’ve tried a million things with clients. I work really closely with them, and finding something clients will use to collaborate with me is difficult. My clients just “get” Basecamp, right away, and use it all the time. They like that they can use it via email. They also love that it has everything they need in one area.

> It’s hard to say since I’ve used Basecamp for the entirety of my career across three separate companies, but I can at least offer an idea of how it’s improving our clients business: The removal of ambiguity in communication. By having a single place to post all messages, files, and deadlines related to a project we remove the possibility of silo’d conversations.

Since I introduced them to Basecamp 3 and got them set up, we are all able to see everything that’s going on, who needs help with what, what tasks need to be done and what is completed in real time.

Before Basecamp, I was the central information hub and nearly all product questions flowed through my email inbox.

With messages in Basecamp, we choose to notify who we need to, but the team at any point can go through the list of comms in the Message board to catch up on the project and get the big picture.

> Our old meetings or conversations, we’d discuss the things that needed to be accomplished for the day or week, each person would write down notes and move on, hoping all those tasks would be finished. Many times they weren’t and our work progress would get slowed down. We came up with a new policy called “action based communication.” Now when employees have meetings or conversations they must finish it with all party’s agreeing on what actions need to be put in Basecamp, the tasks are immediately put in basecamp. We found a 65% quicker rate to finishing tasks, and complications and miss-communications decreased immensely. –Casey Allred, Effect.org

> We’ve had less confusion with task responsibilities and deadlines, which has increased productivity and efficiency. –Dale Lavine, NASA

> Keeps my business focused and aligned with our goals. –Cassandra Freeman, Thoughtful Inspirations

> Actually following processes — before BaseCamp, we had verbally agreed upon processes, or even occasionally documented processes, but they’d be written down in some Operations Manual somewhere that no on knew how to access. Thus, they weren’t followed. With BaseCamp templates, we can change processes, add steps, remove steps, reassign tasks — on the fly so that the process is changed instantaneously.

She’d written me notes while she was working, and I responded right away. That never could have happened before. I then decided to use it for my designer, who is also a freelancer off site. I created a folder for design notes and ideas. Mostly, through, he just uploads new work and we can talk about it in Basecamp. I really, really like how Basecamp gets this stuff out of the text and email stream. –Brian Mooney, Storymatic Studios

> Communication between us and our clients. I work one-on-one with private design clients, but my assistant also takes care of them throughout the process, too.

> More organization and better tracking of processes and progress. –Eric, Booster Club

> We have greatly reduced, almost eliminated, what falls through the cracks. –Ricardo Concepcion, Bathrooms Unique

> When I first started using basecamp I had about 42 people as staff. There was a lot of confusion, wasted time and problems and I was always super stressed and sad. Within a year I cut my team in half yet was able to produce 4X more work. Today I use basecamp with a core team of 8 people who run a 7 figure business with basecamp at the heart of the business. I just returned from 22 days vacation in Krabi, Chiang Mai and Bangkok with my family, it only took me a short glimpse in Basecamp App to know what’s going on and keep my finger on the pulse. During that time, while strolling on the beach, kayaking, or going to Thai cooking school, I gained a huge new client, and garnered rave reviews for the team performance.

My inbox can be a disaster at times.

I’ve also created a mutual support group for a particular class of client (self-published authors), where everyone can see the advice I give to people with a particular problem. This has taken the place of a Facebook Group that never really got off the ground because a lot of my clients aren’t very tech savvy or engaged on social media. –Ben Hourigan, Hourigan & Co.

> Basecamp has allowed me to create a sense of community among my interns and I. Building a startup takes some serious effect, and hours of work after my already existing nine to five.

> We are working on and completing tasks more efficiently with fewer face-to-face meetings that, at times, have been a distraction and time killer when not all players are prepared prior to the meeting.

> The automatic check-ins feature is brilliant! I ask two questions every day: 1. Are you blocked on anything? — every morning to see if we have any obstacle along the way (computer is broken, the client didn’t provide enough information etc). 2. What did you work on today? — at the end of the day. Huge time saver! I don’t ask my team on chat anymore about their activity. –Gabor Kiss, Qbiz Netherlands

> Easier to follow who is doing what and to go back and get people back on track. –Mercedes Perez, Guttmacher Institute

> Communication among our team has improved. We are scattered at four different colleges in the State of Florida and scheduling calls and meetings is difficult.

> Discussions over complex issues are more constructive and less fragmented, and result in more resolutions. –Anthony Drury, LTC

> Being able to focus communications about specific topics in separate message threads seems to make our work more efficient. –Lisa Perkins, Old Dogs New Digs

> We are better able to coordinate efforts by knowing what everyone is doing and we have more time for creative collaboration rather than updating each other on details. –Kim C Nelson, Western Michigan University

> I’ve been able to gather information from our participating study sites much quicker using the automatic check-in feature. –Anusha Krishnadasan, Olive View UCLA Education and Research Institute

> The one thing that has changed is being able to keep ourselves accountable for our tasks. Because we started to put everything in Basecamp (to-dos, events, email threads, ideas, etc) we have been more efficient. We are a multi-media film company and organization is KEY! We now have a place to put our storyboards, checklists and more. Before Basecamp, there wasn’t a dedicated space for these files so we were constantly emailing ourselves the same documents all the time. Now, we can either go on our iPhones or Macs and find things easily. –Alex Villasenor, Emerging Light Media

> We love the archive feature because we run seasonal events so we get to pull it back up a year later with all those details already in place but don’t have to keep it on our dashboard. Campfire is also super exciting for us because we can keep the trail of messages instead of having to search our emails. –Wanda Whipkey, American Elite

> Huge reduction in emails! –Wayne Mylin, AOBTA

> The work has improved, because we can easily share inspiration and feedback across the team on a specific thread. –Angus Gastle, Workspace

> We are much better organized and retain historical information in one place much better instead of it getting lost in a sea of emails over the past few years –Vaibhav Andleigh, Totten Pond Village Condo Association

> Compared to Google Docs, It is easier to bring in new project participants from outside the organization. –Brent Baas, LeTourneau University

> I have better communication with my assistant about all the things going on in my busy tax accounting practice.

> We’ve been able to easily involve our customers and other stakeholders in our projects, and provide constant feedback so that everyone is on the same page. –Chris Pearce, Forsyth Tech

> We are streamlined. Our organization is fully dialled in and we do less email. –Jay Leishman, Leishman & Hornung Online Advertising

> We communicate easier and those communications are more organized and thoughtful. –Loren Greenway, Wilderness Medical Society

> Individual accountability has increased. –Simon Andrews, Kummler + Matter AG

> We’ve all been able to keep up to date on changes on group projects.

Since Basecamp, It’s very easy to make sure that everyone get’s the right information. –Alvaro Pastor, Innovacion Natural

> Things are better communicated as they are all in one place and even when you are not on a project 100%, you can keep track of it. –Gala Fombella Shuckburgh, GEN Europe

> It is better organized, it saves us a lot of time and our mailboxes are empty again. –Vincent Ariens

> Organisation; helps keep all members of a team all working together in one space to get things done faster, preventing cross platform work and therefore items getting missed. –Amy Forde, Iconic Offices

> Being able to post all meeting papers and large documents at the press of a button, took away unnecessary royal mailing of papers. –Maureen Thompson, Teesside Hospice

> We’re more aware of the projects each person is working on. –Jaime Dyer, London EBS

> More transparency. Less emails, and hey what is the status of that? –Susan Delikat, Focus

> Staff have responded really well to the “to-dos". It’s very clear what I expect and when I expect it to be finished. We have employees across Canada so it’s been great to stay organized and connected. –Megan McIver, Central 1 Credit Union

> Prioritization and distribution of our workload. Using the different "reports’ the team can see how our workload stacks across the week. It forces us to be realistic with what we have planned, and we can make quick adjustments and delegate more effectively. Once a task is in Basecamp, I no longer have to worry about whether it will get done. –Nathan Thompson, Sears Holdings

> It would be nearly impossible to run our business without Basecamp. With at least 100 client projects open at any given time and 89 tasks loaded in our new job template the notion of trying to assign tasks, track discussions, tasks and progress without BC is inconceivable. Short answer is the clarity Basecamp brings to the flow of our business. –Mike Malone, Malone & Company

> Less email. Less chaos. –Marc Schegg, 3BaysOver

> A central place to communicate and store docs is huge. –Chris Nevins, Fuel the Mission

> It’s MUCH easier for us to show clients what they need to do when we collaborate on projects. –Chris Bauer, CrunchTime Information Systems

> We are more efficient and less tasks fall through the cracks. Recording every request in a to-do holds everyone to a common system of accountability. Reports allow us to quickly check workloads against different dimensions. We are able to communicate quickly to targeted groups, with additional context just clicks away. –Benjamin Roberts, RSA

> We now are more aware of who is responsible for each task (and for my employees they now get to see all the steps of the process outlined in front of them.) –Tyler Clemens, Outlier

> The communication amongst team members improved dramatically. Rather than my having to make the effort to connect them with each other, Basecamp allowed them to meet virtually right away. –Joe Brand, Generis

> We now have ONE definitive place to deposit files, convey information, and hold discussions. Before it was a hodgepodge of emails (many, many emails), network locations, Sharepoint, and meetings. –Rebecca Doshi, AAAS

> We’ve replaced using emails to manage and collaborate on our projects. Basecamp gives everyone on the team a simple view as to what’s going on, and is useful for projects of any size. And, it’s easy for new members to jump in and contribute because they have access to all of the historical work in the threaded conversations. –Gaelan Lloyd, Winshuttle

> We’re on the same page! Folks have a much better idea of who’s doing what, when, what needs to be done, etc. Our team is brought together and can communicate much more effectively. This puts us on the same page far better than without Basecamp. –Dan Yost, Tri-8 Inc.

> I like the report function that allows us to see what is going on with each person, what due dates are approaching, and how that helps us manage their time. Another change for the better is the strict separation of client from the rest of the team. On Basecamp 2 there was a lot of gray area and it was too easy for a client to get mixed up in the conversations between the team, some of which they should not be involved with or aware of. –Trey Longenecker, Mount Paran Church

> Now we don’t need to going back and forth with emails to rely information. It also makes information much readily available if required. –Terry Huang, Umezushi Ltd.

> Much more fluid way to document conversations and keep track of what we did for who when. –Carina Marano, Visualade

> No more epic email threads to juggle. –David Congreave, Paypershop Ltd.

> We’ve been a lot more productive as a whole. Before Basecamp, we were using Slack. And we suffered from pretty much every single problem that you mentioned in your “Is group chat making you sweat?” article. With Basecamp, everything is focuses. Group chats still happen, but they’re usually scheduled, and they’re always on topic. And there’s always the option of posting a message instead. –Joel Drapper, Indee

> All project related material is stored in a central location. No more searching around network drives and old emails for ’that essential bit of information’ –Nicholas Parkin, Wassen International

> No one has an excuse to say they didn’t see something and everything is in one place. –Charlie Vaughan, Koala

> We now work in a more organized manner. When I came on board as team lead, one of the first things I did was implement a task management software for our team. I had used Jira in the past, but since none of my team had had experience in using task management software, I went with Basecamp for it’s simplicity and straight-forwardness. Since then, we miss fewer deadlines and I can easily delegate action items and keep them organized directly after client calls. –Graham Schmidt, Heaven Media

> We are better organized. I’m able to help my team stay focused by checking their “To Do” list. –Kate Ciangiulli, American Direct Logistics

> More communication — our team sits in a variety of buildings around the County and having a site that allows us to connect and share information quickly has been vital to the success of our projects. –Jodi Ballard-Beach, Multnomah County

> It’s way easier to organize events with many volunteers, to see what is being done and what still needs to be done… –Stephanie Poole

> We have not had misunderstandings regarding due dates and deadlines. –Jaime De La Torre Bravo, Grupo Mann

> Organization from using to-do lists to track what everyone has been up to, and keeping people accountable because everyone else can see everything anyone else does. –Kara Joseph, Zenoti

> It seems like the turnaround time and overall productivity has improved. –Megan Hicks, SC Tobacco-Free Collaborative

> Onboarding new employees and spinning down exiting employees. With project templates, now everyone gets a list of what they need to do; (almost) nothing is forgotten. It’s a much better experience for new employees to have everything organized. –Nick Barth, OnMilwaukee

> Our communication stream is much tighter. We keep all our meeting agendas and summaries in Basecamp making it super easy to stay informed. No more searching through our emails to find the latest agenda — we simply head straight to Basecamp. –Julaine Scott, E-Patches and Crests

> People are talking more… less stuff is being thrown over the proverbial fence. –Tyrone Murphy, NATIONAL Public Relations

> I no longer get emails or texts from employees — they aren’t allowed. My email inbox is no longer my to do list and is mainly client emails that I need to focus. –John Oliver, Complete Home Electronics

> Multiple people update a single entry instead of every individual keeping thier own entry which saves time and costs for our clients. –Evan Holt, Robson Carpenter LLP

> More transparency. I used to have very little contact with some of my team members. The open ’space’ allows a more horizontal communication. Seems like there is less of a hierarchy. Some of my managers who would never hear from each other now hear each other ’speak’. –Christian Brunet, Subway Brunet

> Enthusiasm for being part of a project. –Kim Oeij, City of South Perth Libraries Western Australia

> Quicker and easier communication all coming from one place. –Cory Burns, Adventures in Missions

> Definitely, cooperation and collaboration. Of course I can speak cliches about everybody being on the same page and how one web articles says that and other says what… bla bla bla. Basecamp has helped maturing weekly roundups and planning and pushed us straight to performance and better work. –André Ascensão, SR/SRA

> Less emails! better tracking. More human. –Jean François Porchez, ZeCraft

> Fewer emails. Information is shared more easily. Associates can provide updates on progress — no need to remember everything or write anything down on paper! –Jo Ciriani, Spaghetti Agency

> We’ve consolidated 99 tools into 1 great, simple, organized app called Basecamp. –Chris Meadows, Simple Phone Co.

> Before using Basecamp our organisation was set rigidly into four departments and battled for key resources (e.g. our one developer). We now work much more fluidly on projects and have much greater capacity. –Edward Druce, Get the Guy / Matthew Hussey Coaching

> We are all able to view the progress on each job. Basecamp improves our efficiency working together as a team. –Jenny Skillicorn, JM Engineering, PLLC

> There is more of a feeling of connection. Since most of us work remotely, it is nice to have a cyberspace to share. It feels more intimate, constructive and user friendly than email and the other digital tools. We still use those other digital tools but in a more integrative way. –Marcie Foster, Global Village School

> We are able to keep track of individual tasks for any given project much more efficiently and effectively. Basecamp also allows us to see what others within our team have going on which is critical to help plan work flow and future project deployment. –Mike Krause, Brunswick Bowling Products

> We are able to keep everything in one place and each team member can contribute their portion to projects without issue. –Jillian, Humphries

> For us it’s cross communication between teams. We are talking more than before and sharing documents. –Darryl Diamond, ACCC

> Centralized information lead to higher productivity. –Laura Silva, MYS Project and Brand Management

> Productivity and business understanding. Basecamp puts WeGov on track! –Andre Tamura, WeGov

> It’s so much easier to manage a workload for people that don’t work in my office! I work on design build projects so the contractor team and my design team need to collaborate and this let’s us be fully transparent on what we need and when on both sides of the aisle. –Sarah Fayer, Keimig Associates

> We’re able to stay on the same page more easily instead of trying to figure out some other buggy, inefficient project management software. –William McKinnerney, St. Andrew’s Episcopal School

> Got us out of email hell and provide us with a single location to communicate/plan our business. We have a rule, “If it’s not in basecamp, it doesn’t exist” –Casimir Loeber, RealtyNinja

> My despair has changed to hope. But seriously, I’ve been project managing for a long time, and even as a hyper-organized person, keeping up with every one and every thing takes its tolls. I’ve always wanted some sort of project management program, so once I was introduced to Basecamp I was addicted. –Gabrielle Gniewek

> Nothing is better than watching someone have their epiphany moment when they realize email is not a project management tool. I am now getting even more departments to start using Basecamp religiously rather than every now and again. –Justin McClung, Nex-Tech

> Who’s responsible for what and when it’s due has become more transparent to the whole organization. We have also gotten a lot better at keeping deadlines and delivering the needed results on time. –Hector Artiles, Nurotag

> Having a single place for all of our internal and external communication, project and task tracking has been an incredible improvement for the business. Previously information was partitioned in silos based on the business unit with different platforms. Now we are organized around projects and information is shared across teams by default. –Max Clark, Clarksys Inc.

> Increased and improved communication efficiency and transparency within the projects. No more information lost in mailboxes. –Guy de Pourtalès, eGTSA

> Ensured that we can juggle all aspects of various projects at one time. Improved project-based communication among the different sectors within the team. –Alexander Horne, The Economist

> Cohesive communication. Relying on texts and emails is pretty terrible and not everyone gets looped in, so Basecamp and helped tremendously there. –Brian M.

> We are all on one program vs six or seven. –Felix Martinez, Bella Luci Inc.

> It was a good replacement of e-Mail based communication with too many CCs. –Daniel Schwartz, Logima Software GmbH

> Organization definitely. Take a look at my email for further emphasis there. We have six subteams and it’s so fantastic to have six bascamps for each subteam. Now we can focus more on design, logistics, and goals for each subteam in a centralized area. –Urjita Das, FRC Team 449; The Blair Robot Project

> We’ve always used Basecamp, but, when Basecamp 3 came out we definitely consolidated our toolset. –Chance Griffin, Sturdy

> We can find files, notes, and threads faster than ever before. –Todd Wonders, Unique Venues

> My large interdisciplinary group is developing the ability to stay in touch in multiple fine-grained cycles of development following extremely complex work. –Philip Beesley, Living Architecture Systems Group University of Waterloo

> Overall communication has improved as we can easily invite various stakeholders — both inside the business and outside (vendors). –Crystal Houston, Valley of the Sun United Way

> It’s easy to track both what we’ve done, what we are doing, and what we are going to do. –Gareth Jones, Oxygen 2.0

> It is much easier to keep track of project status with the reports so we get back on track faster when we get off. –Amanda Sutt, Rock Paper Scissors

> More and better communication about potential new user stories and back insights in the real needs behind the statement ’We need this feature’ –Matthieu Hoogerwerf, Negometrix

> We have much better overview of our business development. –Gregor Zupanc, King Consulting / InnCerT

> I’m no longer getting calls from my employees each day asking for the address/phone number of our customers. –Donald Goddard, All About Paint

> Basecamp has been a lifesaver in keeping everyone in the loop on all thats happening without having to shoot thousands of emails back & forth. In addition, all docs are able to remain real-time current by housing them in BC and updating them from there as the project moves forward. This is a game changer for us. –Chris White, Mobilizing Students

> People actually using Basecamp. Prior to basecamp 3, it was difficult to get youth to use it. It did not look as nice, the features weren’t as youth-friendly. –Vincent Irving, Truth Initiative

> Even though we have a small team, communication can be challenging when everyone is on the go. Basecamp helps us juggle multiple projects at the same time and keep communication flowing. –Rita Morris, Latshaw Drilling

> Everyone has fully adopted Basecamp. There’s no hesitation on adoption of the product. –Jasmine Bucher, Lebanon Valley College

> More work done with the same resources or less. –Marius Ion, Angel Hot Soft LLC

> This is how me and my manager stay on track and know what we have to complete each week. It allows us to keep track of small things that have a tendency to slip through the cracks. We have to be deadline oriented in our business and Basecamp helps us accomplish this. –Megan King, Novasyte

> It’s much easier to keep everyone up to speed on projects without having to send out a flood of emails or have twenty different status update meetings. –James Huff, Ramp Logistics

> Alignment on many of our projects — everyone can clearly see who is doing what, when it’s due and if they’re completing tasks on time. –Taryn Johnson, The Joinery

> We don’t have meetings for coordinating to-do lists for events. Everyone can see when something is done or if it is in jeopardy. Others pitch in if we see an issue coming. It’s fantastic! –Kat Larese, PNMR
