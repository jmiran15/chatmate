The best performing AI
----------------------

In a head-to-head study of Intercom's Fin AI Agent and Zendesk's AI bot, Fin performed better across metrics like answer rate, answer accuracy and answer quality.

Fin is able to maintain a conversational flow by asking clarifying questions and taking actions for customers across third party systems. Zendesk's bot lacks these abilities, giving a default reply when it can't answer.

This means Fin will always answer more complex questions than Zendesk. And it's why Fin wins on answer quality metrics like completeness, helpfulness, clarity, and readability.

A seamless, self-improving system
---------------------------------

Intercom's platform is powered by a single connected system. All your content and data can be managed in one place, and your AI agent can hand off to your human agents for a seamless customer experience.

And because AI and humans work together, they learn from each other. So the more issues you resolve, the smarter the system gets—and the better service you provide.

![Image 18: Intercom's self-improving AI System Model](https://images.ctfassets.net/xny2w179f4ki/3uqIxLgob5VtV7xVZfnkuM/1a197cdbafdfe408691a212dbaf53e0f/Group_17909.webp?&q=90&w=1412)
