Trello 101

A productivity powerhouse
-------------------------

Simple, flexible, and powerful. All it takes are boards, lists, and cards to get a clear view of who’s doing what and what needs to get done. Learn more in our [guide for getting started](https://trello.com/guide).

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### +Does Trello offer a Premium free trial?

We sure do. All users can enroll their Workspace in a [free trial of Trello Premium](https://trello.com/premium). With that trial your Workspace will get access to create unlimited Trello boards, automate as much as you’d like, take advantage of Timeline, Dashboard, and other new views, and much more!

### +Do you offer any discounted plans?

Yes! Trello offers both a [non-profit community discount](https://help.trello.com/article/1132-non-profit-discount) as well as an [education discount](https://help.trello.com/article/1133-educational-discount).

### +What payment methods do you accept?

You can purchase a monthly or annual Trello Standard or Premium subscription with any major credit card. We offer more options for Enterprise customers, if you’re interested in learning more about Trello Enterprise [contact our sales team.](https://trello.com/enterprise#contact)

### +How do I cancel my Trello Standard or Premium subscription?

If you aren’t 100% satisfied with Trello Standard or Premium you may downgrade at any time. When a team downgrades from Standard or Premium, it retains its Standard or Premium features and unlimited boards until the end of its prepaid service period. At the end of its prepaid service period, it becomes a free Trello Workspace that can hold 10 boards. Learn more about canceling your Standard or Premium subscription [here.](https://help.trello.com/article/836-cancel-trello-business-class)

### +How are users counted towards billing?

A Trello user who is added as a member to a Workspace—either as a normal member or as a team admin—is considered a billable team member that is included in the cost of Trello Standard or Premium.

Any Guest that is on more than one board within the Workspace is considered a Multi-Board Guest and is billed at the same rate as Standard or Premium Workspace members. [See this page](https://help.trello.com/article/855-how-billing-works-with-trello-business-class) for more information on Multi-Board Guests.

### +Is there an on-premises version of Trello?

Trello is proudly a cloud-only product. We offer access via the web, desktop, and our [awesome mobile apps](https://trello.com/platforms).

### +Can I have Trello Standard or Premium just for my own account?

Trello Standard and Premium are designed for all teams—even teams of one! To upgrade to Standard or Premium you’ll need to create a Workspace and then upgrade that Workspace.

### +How secure is Trello?

Trello, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “our”) is SOC2 Type 2 certified—we receive and review our data hosting providers’ SOC1 and SOC2 reports every 6 months under NDA. Trello is ISO/IEC 27001 certified which validates our information security management system (ISMS) and the implementation of our security controls.

A productivity powerhouse
-------------------------

Simple, flexible, and powerful. All it takes are boards, lists, and cards to get a clear view of who’s doing what and what needs to get done.

#### Boards

Whatever the project or process, boards keep tasks organized and work moving forward. In a glance you can see everything from “things to do” to “aww yeah we did it!”

#### Lists

The different stages of a task. Start as simple as To Do, Doing, or Done—or build a workflow custom fit to your team’s needs. There’s no wrong way to Trello.

#### Cards

Cards represent tasks and can hold all the information you need to get the job done. As you make progress, move cards across lists to show their status.

![Image 7: Illustration of a team Trello Board](https://images.ctfassets.net/rz1oowkt5gyp/4kCNudjaBYj90CGgG7Lict/cbafa67336b2007278f50d99ceabfb22/Boards_2x.png?w=540)

#### Cards

Cards represent tasks and can hold all the information you need to get the job done. As you make progress, move cards across lists to show their status.

Manage tasks with ease
----------------------

Cards keep all of the information your team needs organized and in one place. Assign members, add due dates, leave comments, and more.

### Members

Keep everyone accountable and never have to ask “who’s doing that” by adding members to cards for their projects and tasks.

### Due dates

Doing and due dates go hand in hand. They're easy to set, hard to miss (with reminders!), and oh-so-satisfying to mark as “done.”

### Attachments

No more digging through endless email chains to find attachments. Just drag and drop them onto a card so the right files stay with the right tasks.

### Checklists

Your best tool to overpower overwhelming asks. Break big tasks into small ones, check things off the list, and watch that status bar go to 100% complete.
